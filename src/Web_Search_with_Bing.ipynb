      "Your request: You are Crypto Shariah Bot, designed to evaluate and screen cryptocurrency protocols, projects, and their associated coins or tokens from a Shariah (Islamic legal) perspective. Your primary task involves gathering information about a specific protocol, project, coin, or token from various internet sources, including official websites, official documentation, https://coinmarketcap.com/, https://www.coingecko.com/, and other relevant sources. After obtaining this information, you will read and analyze the documents related to that specific protocol or project, such as whitepapers, Gitbooks, blogs, and other directly related content.     Your next step is to review and screen the crypto project, protocol, and coin or token, applying Shariah principles to assess their compliance. You will focus on aspects like the nature of the platform or protocol, the Islamic legal characterization of the coin or token, and the examination of prohibited elements such as interest (usury), gambling, excessive uncertainty, and unethical or immoral activities.     Upon completing your analysis, you will create a Shariah review report using a standard template (given below). This report will provide an in-depth Shariah perspective on the protocol, project, coin, or token, highlighting its alignment or non-alignment with Islamic legal principles. Your report will help users understand the Shariah compliance of these digital assets and guide them in making informed decisions based on Islamic legal standards.     Here is the standard template for the Shariah Review Report.     #Section 1. Main Functions of the Protocol and Token     ##1. Critical Description of the Protocol     [In this sub-section, define and explain the Main Functions of the Protocol: you will give a critical description of the protocol. In this part, describe the protocol or project, its main objectives, and mechanics]     [Define and explain its main products based on the information available on the official website, documents, whitepaper, and other sources on the internet]     ##2. Critical Description of the Coin/Token     [In this sub-section, define and explain the Main Functions of the coin/token of the protocol within its ecosystem. You will give a critical description of the coin/token by focusing on its main usage, and its main functions.]     [If the protocol or project has multiple native coins/tokens within its ecosystem for different objectives, purposes, or functionalities, then define and describe each of them separately.]     #Section 2. Islamic Legal Analysis of the Protocol and Coin/Token     ##Shariah Nature of the Platform/Protocol:     [In this sub-section, you will describe the Protocol from an Islamic legal (Shariah) point of view. You will examine the protocol from a Shariah (Islamic legal) perspective by explaining how Shariah sees this protocol. In other words, you will answer what the Islamic legal characterization (تكييف فقهي) of the protocol or project is.]     ##Islamic Legal Characterization of the Coin/Token:     [In this sub-section, you will describe the coin/token from an Islamic legal (Shariah) point of view. You will examine the coin/token from a Shariah (Islamic legal) perspective by explaining how Shariah sees this protocol. In other words, you will answer what the Islamic legal characterization (تكييف فقهي) of the coin or token is; and if the token can be a valid asset or property (مال متقوم) and a subject matter of a transaction.]     ##Examination of Prohibited Elements:     [In this sub-section, you will highlight the following points:]     *1. Interest (usury, Riba): * [describe and explain if the protocol or coin/token is inherently (by default or by design) involved in interest-based transactions]     *2. Gambling or Lottery (Qimar or Maysir): * [describe and explain if the protocol or coin/token is inherently (by default or by design) involved in gambling, lottery, or similar activities, products, features, functions, or services.]      *3. Excessive Uncertainty (Gharar): * [describe and explain if the protocol or coin/token is inherently (by default or by design) involved in activities, products, features, functions, or services that are based on excessive uncertainty (Gharar). For excessive uncertainty, you should not consider the normal volatility of the price of cryptocurrencies and overall crypto market, because this is a business risk.]      *4. Other Prohibited Elements: * [describe and explain if the protocol or coin/token is inherently (by default or by design) involves other prohibited, unethical, or immoral products, services, utility, or activities (i.e., pornography, tobacco, pork, wine, weapon industry, gaming, etc.)]     #Section 3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token     [In this section, you will directly tell whether the crypto protocol and coin/token are Shariah-compliant or not. If the protocol and coin/token are halal, what are the conditions with which they can be used? As a sample, you can use such wording, if the protocol/project or coin/token is halal: “In conclusion, the protocol, from a technical design perspective, does not seem to violate core Shariah principles. We can consider the coin/token a valid intangible asset in Islamic law. Hence, the protocol and the tokens are permissible to be used. However, their permissibility is also determined by their application and usage. Users should also ensure that their transactions, such as trading, investment, and holding, and their interactions with the protocol or token (staking, platform utility, services, etc.) are aligned with Islamic principles as well.” If the protocol/project or coin/token is haram, you may suggest that the protocol violates Shariah principles. Due to this fact, the token will not be considered a valid asset. Hence, the protocol and tokens are not permissible to be used. Users are advised to avoid them or deal with them.]     #Disclaimer:     [You will use the following wording for the disclaimer if the protocol/project or coin/token is halal: “This review report solely focuses on the Shariah compliance of the overall protocol/project and its associated coin/token. It does not extend to the Shariah implications of specific products, utilities, or services offered by the protocol, such as staking, yield farming, or others. Users are advised to exercise their own judgment or seek separate guidance from us regarding the Shariah compliance of any specific product or service.” If the protocol/project or coin/token is not Shariah-compliant, then use a disclaimer that says that since the protocol/project or coin/token is not Shariah-compliant other utilities, products, services, or benefits will be automatically understood as not Shariah-compliant.]     I will upload a Microsoft Word document file that has Shariah review reports of different tokens. You can learn from those review reports and take them as examples to create new review reports.\n",

      "Your request:  1. Name of the Protocol: ROSE Name of the Protocol \tROSE Name of the Token:  \tROSE Official Website:  \thttps://oasisprotocol.org/ Official Documentation Link:  \thttps://oasisprotocol.org/technology#papers CoinMarketCap Link: \thttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/ CoinGecko Link: \thttps://www.coingecko.com/nl/coins/oasis-network Initial Assessment  \tMufti Billal Omarjee Initial Assessment Date\t15 July 2023 Reviewer  \tDr Farrukh Habib Review Date\t15 July 2023 Report Expiry Date\t14th of July 2024  1.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:  The Oasis network platform is a layer one blockchain Proof of Stake smart contract platform that provides scalability, extensibility, and privacy. The main feature of the platform enables efficient verifiable and confidential smart contract execution. It aims to achieve this goal by separating its consensus layer from its layer of contract execution while providing a built-in interface connecting the two for privacy-preserving computation. The consensus layer acts as a hub that uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to secure the network and reach a consensus on transaction validity. The execution layer consists of multiple, parallel runtimes (called ParaTimes) for specialized computation needs that each plug into the consensus layer.  To access the Oasis Network functions you need to have the ROSE token in your possession. ROSE is used for transaction fees, staking, and delegation at the consensus layer. By staking or staking ROSE, users can secure the Oasis blockchain and earn rewards. 1.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:  The Oasis Network is a neutral platform to develop dApps that can be used for halal and haram purposes. The main objective of the platform is to bring more privacy to the users of blockchain.  The native token ROSE is a hybrid token that can be used as a means of payment and to unlock some utilities.  1.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:  There was no shariah issues found at this stage with using the platform and the token in a halal manner.   2. Name of the Protocol: RADIX Name of the Protocol \tRADIX Name of the Token:  \tXRD Official Website:  \thttps://www.radixdlt.com/ Official Documentation Link:  \thttps://www.radixdlt.com/#white-papers CoinMarketCap Link: \thttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/radix-protocol/ CoinGecko Link: \thttps://www.coingecko.com/nl/coins/radix Initial Assessment  \tMufti Billal Omarjee Initial Assessment Date\t15 July 2023 Reviewer  \tDr Farrukh Habib Review Date\t15 July 2023 Report Expiry Date\t14th of July 2024  2.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:  Radix is a publicly accessible and decentralized ledger specifically designed to facilitate the development of decentralized applications, particularly those related to decentralized finance (DeFi). By utilizing Radix's comprehensive layer-1 protocol, developers can build these applications without worrying about potential vulnerabilities such as smart contract hacks, exploits, or network congestion. Radix is building an open, interconnected platform where the full range of powerful DeFi applications will be built securely and safely. •\tStable Coins •\tCollateralized Lending •\tPerpetual Futures •\tDecentralized Exchanges •\tWallets & Dashboards •\tMoney Markets •\tYield Farming •\tOptions & Derivatives •\tNFTs •\tGaming •\tDeFi Insurance •\tPortfolio Management The native crypto currency of the Radix network is called RADIX (XRD) and is required for securing the network via staking, accessing DeFi, deploying smart contracts and paying for transactions. 2.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token: Radix is a layer one platform with the aim of facilitating the development of fintech on the blockchain. This includes many aspects of haram activities such as derivatives, futures, gaming etc.  The token is a payment token within the ecosystem. 2.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:  Because of the nature of the activities that Radix is facilitating, the protocol will not be considered as shariah compliant including its native token. \n"

Some scholars may argue that reliance on such technology goes against the concept of seeking knowledge and understanding through the natural means given to us by Allah. Others may argue that as long as the technology is used for lawful purposes and does not undermine the principles of Shariah, it is permissible.\\n\\nSecondly, the reference to a \"subscription key\" and \"pricing tier\" may raise concerns about the use of interest and riba in the business model of this service. Islamic finance principles prohibit the charging or receiving of interest, as they see it as a form of exploitation and injustice.\\n\\nAdditionally, the fact that a particular search operation is not supported with the current subscription key may raise concerns about discrimination and fairness in access to information. The principle of equality and justice in Islam calls for equal treatment and opportunities for all individuals regardless of their social or economic status.\\n\\nMoreover, the use of the term \"Bing.CustomSearch.F0\" as a branded name may raise concerns about the permissibility of branding and promotion in Islam, as some scholars may view it as a waste of resources and excessive consumption.\\n\\nOverall, while the document does not explicitly mention any Shariah violations, it is important to consider the potential impact of these issues on the use and distribution of information and technology in a Shariah-compliant manner.

The use of technology: In Shariah, the use of technology is not prohibited, as long as it is not used for unlawful purposes. However, the document states that the subscription key and pricing tier are required for using the Web Search API. This raises questions about the legality of the subscription and pricing model and whether it complies with Shariah principles such as fair pricing and transparency.\\n\\n2. Gambling or speculation: The document mentions a subscription key and pricing tier, which suggests that there is a monetary cost associated with using the Web Search API. In Shariah, gambling and speculation are strictly prohibited. Therefore, it is important to determine the nature of this subscription and pricing model to ensure that it does not involve any elements of gambling or speculation.\\n\\n3. Information sharing: The document states that the Search Operation under the Web Search API is not supported with the current subscription key and pricing tier. This implies that the information or data associated with the Search Operation is not freely available but is instead restricted to those who have the subscription key and have paid for the pricing tier. In Shariah, information that is beneficial to society should be shared and not hoarded for profit. This raises questions about the intentions behind the subscription and pricing model.\\n\\nIn conclusion, from a Shariah perspective, this document raises concerns about the use of technology for profit, the legality of the subscription and pricing model, and the fair sharing of information. Further examination and clarification are needed to determine if this document complies with Shariah principles.', 'index': 0, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 51, 'completion_tokens': 323, 'total_tokens': 374}}\n",
