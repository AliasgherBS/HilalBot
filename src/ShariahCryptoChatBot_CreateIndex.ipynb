It aims to connect users requiring rendering tasks with individuals having idle GPU resources, thereby democratizing the rendering process and reducing the costs associated with traditional cloud rendering solutions. This protocol thereby promotes a shared economy model where resources are optimally utilized.\\nThe RNDR Token: RNDR, an ERC-20 token, is the native utility token in the Render Network. It's used to compensate individuals providing their GPU resources, ensuring a fair transactional relationship between renderers and those requiring rendering services. RNDR token facilitates payments and acts as an incentive mechanism within the Render ecosystem. It also might be used to prioritize rendering jobs, accessing additional services, or gaining a higher level of service within the Render Network.\\n2.2 Shariah Description of the Render Protocol and RNDR Token:\\nThe Render Network protocol is a decentralized platform based on a peer-to-peer model, steering clear from central authority control. This decentralized nature aligns with Shariah principles of community and fair trade. RNDR, as a utility token, serves as a medium of exchange within a specific ecosystem and does not exhibit characteristics of riba (usury), gharar (uncertainty), or maysir (gambling).\\n2.3 Shariah Opinion of the Render Protocol and RNDR Token:\\nThe Render protocol and its RNDR token do not inherently involve any Shariah-prohibited activities.

This design allows it to achieve its goals of high performance and decentralization. Additionally, MVC incorporates Layer 1 Decentralized Identity (DID) and smart contract technology.\\nKey Features of MicrovisionChain:\\n* Extreme High Performance & Low Fee: MVC emphasizes its ability to handle a large number of transactions efficiently while maintaining minimal fees.\\n* Layer 1 Decentralized Identity (DID): This feature ensures that users on the MVC platform have a unique and decentralized identity.\\n* Smart Contract of UTXO Model: MVC\\'s smart contract functionality is based on the UTXO model, which is different from the account-based model used by platforms like Ethereum.\\n22.1.2. SPACE Token/Coin Description:\\nMain Usage of SPACE:\\nThe exact utilities of the MVC token are not detailed in the official documents. However, given the context, it can be inferred that the token might be used for transaction fees, smart contract execution, and potentially for governance purposes within the MVC ecosystem.\\nMain Functions & Unique Features of SPACE:\\nSpecific functions and unique features of the MVC token are not outlined in the provided content. However, considering the platform\\'s emphasis on low fees and high performance, the token likely plays a role in facilitating these attributes.\\n22.2. Shariah Description of the MicrovisionChain Protocol and SPACE Token:\\nThe MVC platform is a technological infrastructure designed to facilitate decentralized applications and transactions in the Web3 era. From a Shariah perspective, it can be viewed as a tool or medium, similar to how the internet or software is perceived. As long as the primary function of the platform does not involve activities prohibited in Islam, the platform itself can be considered neutral.\\nThe MVC token can be characterized as \"مال متقوم\" (valid property) in Islamic jurisprudence. This is because it possesses value, can be owned, and can be used in transactions. The token serves as a medium of exchange within the MVC ecosystem, and its ownership rights are clear. Therefore, it can be a valid subject matter of a transaction.\\nProhibited Elements in Shariah:\\n* Interest (Usury): There is no indication from the provided information that the MVC protocol or its token involves interest-bearing transactions or activities by design/default.\\n* Gambling (قمار, ميسر): The primary functions of the MVC platform and its token do not seem to involve gambling or any form of speculative games of chance.\\n* Excessive Uncertainty (غرر): The MVC token\\'s value fluctuations due to market dynamics do not constitute the prohibited form of excessive uncertainty in Shariah.\\n* Unethical or Immoral Activities: Based on the provided information, there\\'s no indication that the MVC platform inherently promotes or is involved in unethical or immoral activities.

It was founded by Reflexer Labs in mid 2020 as an initiative to introduce control theory in the crypto space and revive the old vision that was supposed to be implemented for DAI: build a stable currency with no peg and managed by an on-chain, smart contract based controller. \\nRAI claims that DAI was not supposed to be pegged to anything. Rather, it was meant to have a floating target price (aka moving peg) that changes according to what the market price of DAI is on secondary markets. The simplest way to describe the mechanism is that the target price would start to go up when the market price of DAI was below it and, in the scenario where the market price was above the target, the target price would start to go down. This would compel market participants to bring DAI’s market price back and close to the target price. This whole mechanism is now the main driving force behind RAI. \\nRai is a kind of stable coin. It is a non-pegged, ETH backed stable asset built by Reflexer. It is the first asset of its kind that, instead of being pegged to a specific target such as the USD, it freely floats while it is being influenced by market forces. RAI’s mission is to become a crypto native and governance minimized stable asset that is detached from fiat. It is a unique stable currency that has an intrinsic rate which can be either positive or negative. Holders and traders can take advantage of this rate while at the same time stabilize RAI. \\n27.2. Shariah Description of the Rai Reflex Index Protocol and RAI Token: \\nReflexer has a complex mechanism to achieve stability and also has a complicated issuance system for RAI tokens. However, it is understood that the users first need to provide collateral and take a loan in the form of RAI, that is how RAI is issued. It is an upshot of DAI protocol with sort of an improvement regarding pegging. \\nMinting Rai incurs debt as well as exposes the minter to the effects of the redemption rate, which is the rate at which Rai is de or revalued. RAI works similarly to Multi Collateral Dai: every collateral type has its own specific stability fee. Stability fees accrue in the protocol’s balance sheet and from there, governance or an autonomous smart contract can decide how they are used. Furthermore, it is suspected that the debt-based issuance of RAI would involve interest or Riba. Although it is not directly stated in the docs, the main website clearly mentions: “RAI is an ETH backed stable asset. You can use it to take out loans against your ETH at a small interest rate.” \\n27.3.

The protocol is designed to be resistant to government surveillance and censorship. Monero is also designed to be scalable, so that it can be used by many people.\\n19.1.2. The XMR Token\\nThe Monero token (XMR) is the native cryptocurrency of the Monero network. It is used to pay for transactions on the network, to secure the network through mining, and to participate in governance.\\nXMR is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency. This means that it is mined by solving computationally difficult problems. The network is secured by a network of miners who compete to solve these problems.\\nXMR holders can also participate in governance by voting on proposals that affect the Monero network. These proposals can include changes to the network's protocol, the distribution of rewards, and other matters.\\n19.2. Shariah Description of the Monero Protocol and XMR Token:\\nThe Monero protocol is a decentralized platform that allows users to send and receive Monero tokens without revealing their identity. It is designed to be secure, private, and scalable.\\nFrom a Shariah perspective, it does not directly involve any prohibited activities, such as interest, gambling, or excessive uncertainty. The protocol is also decentralized, which means that it is not subject to the control of any single entity. This makes it a more secure and trustworthy platform for conducting transactions.\\nThe Monero token (XMR) is a utility token that is used to pay for fees on the Monero network, to secure the network through mining, and to participate in governance.\\nFrom a Shariah perspective, it is not a security or a derivative, and it does not represent any ownership interest in the Monero network. XMR is simply a tool that can be used to participate in the network and earn rewards.\\nSome people argue that Monero could be, and has been, used for illegal activities, such as, payment for illegal goods and services, money laundering and terrorist financing. Based on that the use of Monero for such purposes is definitely not Shariah-compliant, and such transactions and activities would be invalid and impermissible from the Shariah perspective. But it does not make Monero token itself a haram subject matter or object because these activities or transactions are not an integral part or component of the protocol itself.\\n19.3. Shariah Opinion of the Monero Protocol and XMR Token:\\nBased on the above analysis, the Monero protocol and token both can be considered halal if they are used in a Shariah-compliant manner. They are decentralized platforms that do not directly involve any prohibited activities. XMR is a payment token that can also be used to participate in the network and earn rewards.\\n__\", metadata={'protocol': 'Monero'}),\n",

Shariah Description of the MicrovisionChain Protocol and SPACE Token:\\nThe MVC platform is a technological infrastructure designed to facilitate decentralized applications and transactions in the Web3 era. From a Shariah perspective, it can be viewed as a tool or medium, similar to how the internet or software is perceived. As long as the primary function of the platform does not involve activities prohibited in Islam, the platform itself can be considered neutral.\\nThe MVC token can be characterized as \"مال متقوم\" (valid property) in Islamic jurisprudence. This is because it possesses value, can be owned, and can be used in transactions. The token serves as a medium of exchange within the MVC ecosystem, and its ownership rights are clear. Therefore, it can be a valid subject matter of a transaction.\\nProhibited Elements in Shariah:\\n* Interest (Usury): There is no indication from the provided information that the MVC protocol or its token involves interest-bearing transactions or activities by design/default.\\n* Gambling (قمار, ميسر): The primary functions of the MVC platform and its token do not seem to involve gambling or any form of speculative games of chance.\\n* Excessive Uncertainty (غرر): The MVC token\\'s value fluctuations due to market dynamics do not constitute the prohibited form of excessive uncertainty in Shariah.\\n* Unethical or Immoral Activities: Based on the provided information, there\\'s no indication that the MVC platform inherently promotes or is involved in unethical or immoral activities.

       " Document(page_content='Main Function of the Rai Reflex Index Protocol and RAI Token: \\nReflexer is a smart contract lending platform that allows anyone to use their crypto collateral and take out loans in the form of RAI. It was founded by Reflexer Labs in mid 2020 as an initiative to introduce control theory in the crypto space and revive the old vision that was supposed to be implemented for DAI: build a stable currency with no peg and managed by an on-chain, smart contract based controller. \\nRAI claims that DAI was not supposed to be pegged to anything. Rather, it was meant to have a floating target price (aka moving peg) that changes according to what the market price of DAI is on secondary markets. The simplest way to describe the mechanism is that the target price would start to go up when the market price of DAI was below it and, in the scenario where the market price was above the target, the target price would start to go down. This would compel market participants to bring DAI’s market price back and close to the target price. This whole mechanism is now the main driving force behind RAI. \\nRai is a kind of stable coin. It is a non-pegged, ETH backed stable asset built by Reflexer. It is the first asset of its kind that, instead of being pegged to a specific target such as the USD, it freely floats while it is being influenced by market forces. RAI’s mission is to become a crypto native and governance minimized stable asset that is detached from fiat. It is a unique stable currency that has an intrinsic rate which can be either positive or negative. Holders and traders can take advantage of this rate while at the same time stabilize RAI. \\n27.2. Shariah Description of the Rai Reflex Index Protocol and RAI Token: \\nReflexer has a complex mechanism to achieve stability and also has a complicated issuance system for RAI tokens. However, it is understood that the users first need to provide collateral and take a loan in the form of RAI, that is how RAI is issued. It is an upshot of DAI protocol with sort of an improvement regarding pegging. \\nMinting Rai incurs debt as well as exposes the minter to the effects of the redemption rate, which is the rate at which Rai is de or revalued. RAI works similarly to Multi Collateral Dai: every collateral type has its own specific stability fee. Stability fees accrue in the protocol’s balance sheet and from there, governance or an autonomous smart contract can decide how they are used. Furthermore, it is suspected that the debt-based issuance of RAI would involve interest or Riba. Although it is not directly stated in the docs, the main website clearly mentions: “RAI is an ETH backed stable asset. You can use it to take out loans against your ETH at a small interest rate.” \\n27.3.

The first being Dai, a collateral-backed stablecoin that offers stability. It is required to have any business or individual realize the advantages of digital money. Second, there is MKR, a governance token that is used by stakeholders to maintain the system and manage Dai. MKR token holders are the decision-makers of the Maker Protocol, supported by the larger public community and various other external parties.\\nIt accepts any Ethereum-based asset as collateral to generate Dai given that it has been approved by MKR holders and has been given specific, corresponding Risk Parameters through the Maker decentralized governance process.\\n18.1.2. The DAI Token\\nThe Dai stablecoin is a decentralized, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Dai is held in cryptocurrency wallets or within platforms and is supported on Ethereum and other popular blockchains.\\nUsers generate Dai by depositing collateral assets into Maker Vaults within the Maker Protocol. This is how Dai is entered into circulation and how users gain access to liquidity. Others obtain Dai by buying it from brokers or exchanges, or simply by receiving it as a means of payment.\\nEvery Dai in circulation is directly backed by excess collateral, meaning that the value of the collateral is higher than the value of the Dai debt, and all Dai transactions are publicly viewable on the Ethereum blockchain.\\nIt is important to differentiate between Multi-Collateral DAI and Single-Collateral DAI (SAI), an earlier version of the token that could only be collateralized by a single cryptocurrency; SAI also doesn’t support the DAI Savings Rate, which allows users to earn interest by holding DAI tokens.\\n18.2. Shariah Description of the Dai Protocol and DAI Token:\\nDAI is created out of loans made by the platform to the users. The interest on these loans is paid through the stability fee. This stability fee should not be confused with a maintenance fee or service fee for using the Maker Vault. It is clear that the crypto deposits are used as collateral for borrowing DAI. Hence, if the collateralization ratio drops below 150% the trader’s collateral will be liquidated to pay off their loan.\\nIn this way, DAI is created out of an interest-based loan (transaction). Interest-based loans or transactions are not Shariah-compliant.\\n18.3. Shariah Opinion of the Dai Protocol and DAI Token:\\nBased on the above discussion, DAI is not Shariah-compliant. Therefore, it is not allowed to transact with or deal in it.', metadata={'protocol': 'Dai'}),\n",

The protocol is designed to be resistant to government surveillance and censorship. Monero is also designed to be scalable, so that it can be used by many people.\\n19.1.2. The XMR Token\\nThe Monero token (XMR) is the native cryptocurrency of the Monero network. It is used to pay for transactions on the network, to secure the network through mining, and to participate in governance.\\nXMR is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency. This means that it is mined by solving computationally difficult problems. The network is secured by a network of miners who compete to solve these problems.\\nXMR holders can also participate in governance by voting on proposals that affect the Monero network. These proposals can include changes to the network's protocol, the distribution of rewards, and other matters.\\n19.2. Shariah Description of the Monero Protocol and XMR Token:\\nThe Monero protocol is a decentralized platform that allows users to send and receive Monero tokens without revealing their identity. It is designed to be secure, private, and scalable.\\nFrom a Shariah perspective, it does not directly involve any prohibited activities, such as interest, gambling, or excessive uncertainty. The protocol is also decentralized, which means that it is not subject to the control of any single entity. This makes it a more secure and trustworthy platform for conducting transactions.\\nThe Monero token (XMR) is a utility token that is used to pay for fees on the Monero network, to secure the network through mining, and to participate in governance.\\nFrom a Shariah perspective, it is not a security or a derivative, and it does not represent any ownership interest in the Monero network. XMR is simply a tool that can be used to participate in the network and earn rewards.\\nSome people argue that Monero could be, and has been, used for illegal activities, such as, payment for illegal goods and services, money laundering and terrorist financing. Based on that the use of Monero for such purposes is definitely not Shariah-compliant, and such transactions and activities would be invalid and impermissible from the Shariah perspective. But it does not make Monero token itself a haram subject matter or object because these activities or transactions are not an integral part or component of the protocol itself.\\n19.3.

It was founded by Reflexer Labs in mid 2020 as an initiative to introduce control theory in the crypto space and revive the old vision that was supposed to be implemented for DAI: build a stable currency with no peg and managed by an on-chain, smart contract based controller. \\nRAI claims that DAI was not supposed to be pegged to anything. Rather, it was meant to have a floating target price (aka moving peg) that changes according to what the market price of DAI is on secondary markets. The simplest way to describe the mechanism is that the target price would start to go up when the market price of DAI was below it and, in the scenario where the market price was above the target, the target price would start to go down. This would compel market participants to bring DAI’s market price back and close to the target price. This whole mechanism is now the main driving force behind RAI. \\nRai is a kind of stable coin. It is a non-pegged, ETH backed stable asset built by Reflexer. It is the first asset of its kind that, instead of being pegged to a specific target such as the USD, it freely floats while it is being influenced by market forces. RAI’s mission is to become a crypto native and governance minimized stable asset that is detached from fiat. It is a unique stable currency that has an intrinsic rate which can be either positive or negative. Holders and traders can take advantage of this rate while at the same time stabilize RAI. \\n27.2. Shariah Description of the Rai Reflex Index Protocol and RAI Token: \\nReflexer has a complex mechanism to achieve stability and also has a complicated issuance system for RAI tokens. However, it is understood that the users first need to provide collateral and take a loan in the form of RAI, that is how RAI is issued.

RAI works similarly to Multi Collateral Dai: every collateral type has its own specific stability fee. Stability fees accrue in the protocol’s balance sheet and from there, governance or an autonomous smart contract can decide how they are used. Furthermore, it is suspected that the debt-based issuance of RAI would involve interest or Riba.

Viridis Network's \"Green Staking\" seems to be a unique feature where participants can stake their tokens to support environmental sustainability projects. However, I couldn't find specific details about the mechanism of Green Staking on the official Viridis Network website. As such, it's unclear whether this staking mechanism involves Riba (interest) in the traditional sense. Usually, staking in the crypto context involves earning rewards for holding and supporting the network, but whether this constitutes Riba depends on the specific structure and nature of the rewards.\n",

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\nThe Oasis network platform is a layer one blockchain Proof of Stake smart contract platform that provides scalability, extensibility, and privacy. The main feature of the platform enables efficient verifiable and confidential smart contract execution. It aims to achieve this goal by separating its consensus layer from its layer of contract execution while providing a built-in interface connecting the two for privacy-preserving computation. The consensus layer acts as a hub that uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to secure the network and reach a consensus on transaction validity. The execution layer consists of multiple, parallel runtimes (called ParaTimes) for specialized computation needs that each plug into the consensus layer.\\nTo access the Oasis Network functions you need to have the ROSE token in your possession. ROSE is used for transaction fees, staking, and delegation at the consensus layer. By staking or staking ROSE, users can secure the Oasis blockchain and earn rewards.\\n1.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\nThe Oasis Network is a neutral platform to develop dApps that can be used for halal and haram purposes. The main objective of the platform is to bring more privacy to the users of blockchain.\\nThe native token ROSE is a hybrid token that can be used as a means of payment and to unlock some utilities.\\n1.3.

Name of the Protocol: KOINOS\\n\\n3.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\nKoinos is a blockchain-based decentralized network that aims to create a fee-less and accessible environment for decentralized applications (dApps). It introduces a unique mechanism called \"Mana\" to dynamically price network resources based on opportunity cost, allowing for free-to-use applications. The consensus algorithm, known as proof-of-burn, maximizes efficiency, decentralization, and egalitarianism while deterring attacks and spam. Koinos utilizes a modular upgradeability approach for seamless and fork-less upgrades. The goal is to provide a user-friendly and truly decentralized blockchain framework that empowers developers and maximizes accessibility for end-users, developers, and node operators.\\nKOIN is the native token of the Koinos blockchain network and serves several purposes within the ecosystem:\\nMeans of exchange\\nVoting rights\\nEarning MANA power\\n3.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\nKoinos is a neutral platform with the aim of bringing more people to use blockchain technology. In that sense, it can accommodate halal and haram activities. However, it seems that its main objective is to serve Web3 gaming, Defi, and social apps. This may raise some concerns from the shariah perspective.\\nThe KOIN token is a hybrid token that can be used for payment as well as access to utilities such as governance right.\\n3.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\nIf the platform is used in a shariah compliant manner along with the token, then there might be no issues. However, it is better to avoid this protocol and token due its focus on gaming and Defi.\\n4. Name of the Protocol: TRIAS\\n\\n4.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\nTRIAS is a blockchain project that aims to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps). TRIAS stands for \"Trustworthy and Reliable Intelligent Autonomous Systems\" and aims to address key challenges in blockchain technology, including scalability, security, and privacy.\\nTRIAS combines trusted execution environments (TEEs) with a consensus algorithm called \"PoWER\" (Proof of Writing Execution Results) to create a secure and scalable platform for dApps. By utilizing TEEs, TRIAS ensures the integrity and confidentiality of smart contracts and sensitive data. TEEs enable the execution of code in a secure and isolated environment, protecting against tampering and unauthorized access.\\nThe PoWER consensus algorithm in TRIAS involves a combination of writing and executing smart contracts to achieve consensus. This approach allows for efficient verification of contract execution results and enhances the security and efficiency of the blockchain network.\\nIn addition to its focus on security and scalability, TRIAS also emphasizes privacy.

Its use for governance, staking, and accessing premium features aligns with the principles of Islamic finance, provided the underlying activities are Shariah-compliant.\\nExamination of Prohibited Elements:\\nInterest (Usury): If the token involves interest-bearing transactions or promises guaranteed returns, it would conflict with the prohibition of Riba in Islamic finance.\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): The token must not be used for activities resembling gambling or speculative ventures without real value.\\nExcessive Uncertainty (غرر): While normal crypto volatility is not considered excessive uncertainty, the token must ensure transparency and avoid ambiguous or highly uncertain transactions.\\nUnethical/Immoral Activities: The platform and token must avoid facilitating or promoting activities that are considered unethical or immoral in Islam, such as investments in alcohol, gambling industries, etc.\\n16.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\nIn conclusion, the protocol, from a foundational perspective, doesn\\'t seem to violate core Shariah principles. The token can be considered a valid property in Islamic law. Hence, the protocol and the tokens are permissible to be used.

Its focus on renewable energy resonates with the Islamic ethos of stewardship over the environment.\\nIslamic Legal Characterization of the Token:\\nThe Dione token, as a digital asset within this ecosystem, could be seen as \"مال متقوم\" (valid property) in Islamic jurisprudence, especially if it represents a stake in a permissible venture and has economic value.\\nExamination of Prohibited Elements:\\nGharar (Uncertainty): The protocol and token seem to have clear objectives and functionalities, reducing concerns of excessive uncertainty.\\nRiba (Usury): There\\'s no evidence of interest-based transactions or lending with predefined returns within the protocol.\\nMaysir (Gambling): The protocol does not appear to involve speculative trading or gambling elements.\\nOther Unethical Activities: The protocol\\'s focus on green energy and sustainability does not indicate involvement in any activities prohibited in Islam.\\n18.4. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\nBased on the available information, there are no apparent elements in the Dione Protocol or its token that contradict Shariah principles, making them potentially Shariah-compliant. However, this assessment is conditional and based on the current understanding of the protocol\\'s operations. The token can be considered a valid property in Islamic law. Hence, the protocol and the tokens are permissible to be used. However, their permissibility is also determined by their application and usage. Users should also ensure that their interactions/transactions, such as trading, investment, and holding, with the protocol or token are aligned with Islamic principles as well.\\n\\n19. Name of the Protocol: Viridis Network\\n19.1. Main Functions of Viridis Network and Token\\n1. Protocol Description\\nThe Viridis Network focuses on integrating cryptocurrency with environmental sustainability. Its main objectives include promoting eco-friendly initiatives through blockchain technology and incentivizing sustainable practices. The protocol seems to integrate features like reduced gas fees and support for environmental projects.\\n2. Token Description\\nThe Viridis token (VRD) appears to be used within this ecosystem to support and encourage eco-friendly activities. It might be utilized for transactions within the network and possibly for participating in sustainability-focused initiatives.\\n19.2. Shariah Perspective of Viridis Network and Token\\nShariah Nature of the Protocol\\nThe Viridis Network\\'s focus on environmental sustainability aligns with Islamic principles of stewardship and ethical conduct. If the network\\'s activities and supported projects adhere to Islamic guidelines, it can be considered Shariah-compliant.\\nIslamic Legal Characterization of the Token\\nAs a digital asset that supports eco-friendly initiatives, the VRD token could be seen as \"مال متقوم\" (valid property) in Islamic law, provided its use and functionalities remain within permissible boundaries.\\nExamination for Prohibited Elements\\nThere are no apparent elements in the protocol or token that suggest involvement in activities prohibited in Islam, such as interest (usury), gambling, excessive uncertainty, or unethical activities. This assessment is based on the information currently available and might change with new information.\\nThere is a mention of the Sustainable ‘Interest’ under the Green Staking feature of the protocol. Viridis Network\\'s \"Green Staking\" seems to be a unique feature where participants can stake their tokens to support environmental sustainability projects. However, I couldn\\'t find specific details about the mechanism of Green Staking on the official Viridis Network website. As such, it\\'s unclear whether this staking mechanism involves Riba (interest) in the traditional sense. Usually, staking in the crypto context involves earning rewards for holding and supporting the network, but whether this constitutes Riba depends on the specific structure and nature of the rewards.\\nI tend to see it as a misuse of the term ‘interest’, because there is no clear borrowing-lending mechanism. Moreover, in Green Staking, the rewards are not guaranteed and depend on various factors, including the amount of VRD staked, the length of the staking period, and the overall performance of the network. Therefore, it might not be an issue, unless further information states otherwise.\\n19.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\nBased on the available information, there are no apparent elements in the Viridis Protocol or its token that contradict Shariah principles, making them potentially Shariah-compliant. However, this assessment is conditional and based on the current understanding of the protocol\\'s operations. The token can be considered a valid property in Islamic law. Hence, the protocol and the tokens are permissible to be used. However, their permissibility is also determined by their application and usage. Users should also ensure that their interactions/transactions, such as trading, investment, and holding, with the protocol or token are aligned with Islamic principles as well.\\n\\n20.

Critical Description of the Token/Coin\\nThe Creso token, identified as CRE, can be used for various transactions within the Creso ecosystem. The token also supports features like adding it to MetaMask for more convenient access and usage in decentralized finance activities.\\n20.2. Islamic Legal (Shariah) Perspective\\nShariah Nature of the Platform or Protocol\\nFrom an Islamic legal perspective, the Creso protocol appears to be a digital platform facilitating secure and efficient crypto-asset management, aligning with permissible activities under Shariah law. Its emphasis on security and ease of use does not inherently involve any Shariah-prohibited activities.\\nIslamic Legal Characterization of the Token\\nThe CRE token, serving as a medium in digital transactions, can be considered a \\'Māl Mutawwam\\' (valued property) within Islamic jurisprudence. This is because it holds economic value and can be lawfully exchanged.\\nProhibited Elements in Shariah\\nInterest (Usury): There\\'s no indication that the Creso platform or the CRE token involves interest-based transactions, which are prohibited in Shariah.\\nGambling (Qimar) and Speculation (Maisir): The platform\\'s primary function does not seem to revolve around gambling or speculative, high-risk investments.\\nExcessive Uncertainty (Gharar): While the cryptocurrency market is volatile, this volatility is considered a business risk rather than the prohibited excessive uncertainty (Gharar) in Shariah. The platform itself does not introduce additional elements of Gharar.\\nUnethical or Immoral Activities: There is no evidence suggesting that Creso is involved in any activities deemed unethical or immoral under Islamic law.\\n20.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\nIn conclusion, based on the information available, Creso and its CRE token do not exhibit elements that are explicitly prohibited in Shariah. However, continuous monitoring and analysis are advisable, given the dynamic nature of digital financial platforms and cryptocurrencies. The token can be considered a valid property in Islamic law. Hence, the protocol and the tokens are permissible to be used. However, their permissibility is also determined by their application and usage.
