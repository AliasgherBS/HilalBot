Instead of users, smart contracts can also request data securely from AI APIs through Oraichain. The blockchain network is built based on Cosmos SDK along with Terdemint’s Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus that helps speed up transactions’ confirmation time.\\n\\nThe ORAI consensus protocol bears similarities to the delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) mechanism. In this network, multiple validators participate, each of whom possesses ORAI tokens. Meanwhile, other holders of ORAI tokens can serve as delegators by staking their tokens with validators and receiving rewards for each newly generated block.\\n\\nAdditionally, validators have a secondary responsibility of gathering data from AI providers and validating its accuracy prior to recording it on the blockchain. The validation process involves testing the AI API using test cases provided by users, smart contracts, and test providers. In cases where users are unsure about suitable test cases, they have the option to request them from test providers.\\n\\nNative ORAI tokens are required to secure and power the decentralized oracle network of validators. The native ORAI token is used in different scenarios below:\\n\\nStaking for validators: all validators are required to stake ORAI to be selected to create a block or fulfill data requests.\\n\\nTransaction fee: the ORAI token is required to run an AI request sent to the Oraichain network.\\n\\nParticipation in network governance: the Oraichain network is organized in the DAO manner, all protocol upgrades and parameter changes must be voted by token holders.\\n\\n5.2.

Its main objectives include promoting eco-friendly initiatives through blockchain technology and incentivizing sustainable practices. The protocol seems to integrate features like reduced gas fees and support for environmental projects.\\n\\n2. Token Description\\n\\nThe Viridis token (VRD) appears to be used within this ecosystem to support and encourage eco-friendly activities. It might be utilized for transactions within the network and possibly for participating in sustainability-focused initiatives.\\n\\n19.2. Shariah Perspective of Viridis Network and Token\\n\\nShariah Nature of the Protocol\\n\\nThe Viridis Network\\'s focus on environmental sustainability aligns with Islamic principles of stewardship and ethical conduct. If the network\\'s activities and supported projects adhere to Islamic guidelines, it can be considered Shariah-compliant.\\n\\nIslamic Legal Characterization of the Token\\n\\nAs a digital asset that supports eco-friendly initiatives, the VRD token could be seen as \"مال متقوم\" (valid property) in Islamic law, provided its use and functionalities remain within permissible boundaries.\\n\\nExamination for Prohibited Elements\\n\\nThere are no apparent elements in the protocol or token that suggest involvement in activities prohibited in Islam, such as interest (usury), gambling, excessive uncertainty, or unethical activities. This assessment is based on the information currently available and might change with new information.\\n\\nThere is a mention of the Sustainable ‘Interest’ under the Green Staking feature of the protocol. Viridis Network\\'s \"Green Staking\" seems to be a unique feature where participants can stake their tokens to support environmental sustainability projects. However, I couldn\\'t find specific details about the mechanism of Green Staking on the official Viridis Network website. As such, it\\'s unclear whether this staking mechanism involves Riba (interest) in the traditional sense. Usually, staking in the crypto context involves earning rewards for holding and supporting the network, but whether this constitutes Riba depends on the specific structure and nature of the rewards.\\n\\nI tend to see it as a misuse of the term ‘interest’, because there is no clear borrowing-lending mechanism. Moreover, in Green Staking, the rewards are not guaranteed and depend on various factors, including the amount of VRD staked, the length of the staking period, and the overall performance of the network. Therefore, it might not be an issue, unless further information states otherwise.\\n\\n19.3.

The Protocol:\\n\\nThe Secret Network is the first blockchain with privacy-preserving smart contracts, aiming to bring data privacy to public blockchains. This protocol allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that utilize encrypted data without revealing it, enabling more secure and private interactions. The Secret Network offers scalable, permissionless, and privacy-preserving smart contract computation, aiming to bring data privacy to public blockchains.\\n\\n5.1.2. The Token:\\n\\nThe SCRT token is the native utility token of the Secret Network. SCRT are used for various network activities such as paying for transaction fees, participating in network governance, and potentially for staking to secure the network.\\n\\n5.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Secret Network operates on a decentralized model, which aligns with the Shariah principles of removing undue intermediaries and promoting transparency, albeit the network specializes in privacy-preserving computations. The decentralized nature of the network avoids the concentration of power and the potential for unfair practices.\\n\\nThe SCRT token as a utility token doesn't inherently involve prohibited activities like Riba (usury), Gharar (uncertainty), or Maysir (gambling).\\n\\n5.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe core protocol and the SCRT token do not appear to involve any Haram (forbidden) elements from the information available at the official resources. However, the privacy aspect, if used for unethical or unlawful purposes, can be problematic from a Shariah standpoint. Hence, while the technology and the token could be deemed permissible, their usage should adhere to Islamic ethics and financial guidelines to ensure Shariah compliance.

An internet where no one can control what will be said and what will be kept silent. A platform where people can freely and privately buy and sell cryptocurrency and government and corporate surveillance is impossible. tomi is a place where the citizens are the ones who decide what should and should not be censored, where the big media companies no longer determine what we can see and what we can't.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n12.1.1. The Protocol and the Token\\n\\nDogecoin (DOGE) is based on the popular \"doge\" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. The open-source digital currency was forked from Litecoin in December 2013. Dogecoin\\'s creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was based on a dog meme. Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted several tweets on social media that Dogecoin is his favorite coin.\\n\\nAccording to the whitepaper, Dogecoin is a community-driven cryptocurrency that was inspired by a Shiba Inu meme. The Dogecoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Dogecoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Bitcoin Core and other cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n12.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nDOGE is considered to be a cryptocurrency similar to BTC. It should therefore fall into the category of money. However, Doge does not seem to have an actual utility, at least at the moment. It was launched as a mockery or competitor of Bitcoin. While the platform boasts about being decentralized and community driven, but without a clear objective. \\n\\nA deep analysis of the whitepaper clearly shows that it does not have a real economic objective. It only got famous due to speculation only. Elon Musk’s tweets also fueled the speculative activity with this token.\\n\\n12.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIt is clear that this token has no well-defined purpose, utility or any other benefit on which a shariah ruling can be based. It is purely a speculative token, which people bet on for unusual price action. In this sense, its usage is questionable, and its harm is greater than its benefits. Moreover, the whole branding of the platform and token is related to a dog-breed which might be a shariah issue as well.  \\n\\nIt might not have a shariah issue at micro - issuance, default nature - or technological - blockchain, crypto token - level.

This mechanism allows for more efficient and secure transactions, and it also makes the network more resistant to attack.\\n\\nThe TON protocol also features several other innovations, such as its use of dynamic sharding and its support for smart contracts. These innovations make the TON protocol a powerful platform for a wide range of applications. These include TON Blockchain, TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. TON Blockchain is the core protocol that connects TON’s underlying infrastructure together to form the TON Ecosystem.\\n\\nThe TON Project uses its own peer-to-peer network protocols.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n15.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nThe Cosmos SDK is an open-source framework for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, like the Cosmos Hub, as well as permissioned Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchains. Blockchains built with the Cosmos SDK are generally referred to as application-specific blockchains.\\n\\nThe Cosmos protocol is a framework for building blockchains that are interoperable with each other. It is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to use. The Cosmos protocol is based on the Tendermint consensus algorithm, which is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm. This means that the Cosmos network can continue to operate even if some of the nodes in the network fail.\\n\\nThe Cosmos protocol has several features that make it well-suited for building interoperable blockchains. These features include:\\n\\n•\\tInteroperability: The Cosmos protocol allows blockchains to communicate with each other through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. This means that users can transfer tokens and data between different blockchains.\\n\\n•\\tScalability: The Cosmos protocol is designed to be scalable. This means that it can handle many transactions without becoming congested.\\n\\n•\\tSecurity: The Cosmos protocol is designed to be secure. This is achieved using the Tendermint consensus algorithm and other security features.\\n\\n15.1.2. The Token\\n\\nThe Cosmos token (ATOM) is the native cryptocurrency of the Cosmos network. It is used to pay for fees on the Cosmos network, to secure the network through staking, and to participate in governance.\\n\\nATOM is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) cryptocurrency. This means that users can earn rewards by staking their ATOM tokens. Staking is the process of locking up ATOM tokens in order to participate in the consensus process.\\n\\nATOM holders can also participate in governance by voting on proposals that affect the Cosmos network. These proposals can include changes to the network's protocol, the distribution of rewards, and other matters.\\n\\n15.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Cosmos protocol is a decentralized platform that allows developers to build blockchains that are interoperable with each other. It is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to use.\\n\\nFrom a Shariah perspective, it does not involve any prohibited activities, such as interest, gambling, or excessive uncertainty. The protocol is also decentralized, which means that it is not subject to the control of any single entity. This makes it a more secure and trustworthy platform for conducting transactions.\\n\\nThe Cosmos token (ATOM) is a utility token that is used to pay for fees on the Cosmos network, to secure the network through staking, and to participate in governance.\\n\\nFrom a Shariah perspective, it is not a security or a derivative, and it does not represent any ownership interest in the Cosmos network. ATOM is simply a tool that can be used to participate in the network and earn rewards.\\n\\n15.3.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n16.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nAlgorand is a decentralized blockchain-based network designed to support a broad spectrum of applications. The primary goal of Algorand is to offer systems that are secure, scalable, and efficient, which are essential attributes for real-world applications. Algorand aims to establish new forms of trust by ensuring that these systems are self-sustaining. The protocol is unique in that it is designed to be a truly democratic and efficient way to implement a public ledger. Unlike traditional proof-of-work systems, Algorand operates on a negligible amount of computation and produces a transaction history that is highly unlikely to fork.\\n\\nThe platform has introduced several innovations, such as the Pixel multi-signature scheme optimized for blockchains, the Vault cryptocurrency design that minimizes storage and bootstrapping costs, and a Byzantine Agreement protocol that ensures consensus among users on the next set of transactions.\\n\\n16.1.2. The Token \\n\\nThe Algorand token, known as ALGO, serves as the native cryptocurrency of the Algorand network. It is used to facilitate transactions within the ecosystem. ALGO tokens are also essential for participating in the Algorand network\\'s consensus mechanism. Holders of ALGO can participate in the network\\'s decision-making process, thereby ensuring the platform\\'s decentralization.\\n\\nOne of the standout features of the ALGO token is its role in Algorand\\'s Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism. This approach ensures that every user\\'s influence on the choice of a new block is proportional to their stake, without the need for the energy-intensive calculations required in proof-of-work systems.\\n\\n16.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nAlgorand, as a blockchain platform, is fundamentally a digital infrastructure that facilitates decentralized transactions and applications. From a Shariah perspective, it can be viewed as a digital tool or medium, similar to how traditional financial systems and tools are viewed.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n18.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nMakerDAO is a decentralized organization. The Maker Protocol employs a two-token system. The first being Dai, a collateral-backed stablecoin that offers stability. It is required to have any business or individual realize the advantages of digital money. Second, there is MKR, a governance token that is used by stakeholders to maintain the system and manage Dai. MKR token holders are the decision-makers of the Maker Protocol, supported by the larger public community and various other external parties.\\n\\nIt accepts any Ethereum-based asset as collateral to generate Dai given that it has been approved by MKR holders and has been given specific, corresponding Risk Parameters through the Maker decentralized governance process.\\n\\n18.1.2. The Token\\n\\nThe Dai stablecoin is a decentralized, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Dai is held in cryptocurrency wallets or within platforms and is supported on Ethereum and other popular blockchains.\\n\\nUsers generate Dai by depositing collateral assets into Maker Vaults within the Maker Protocol. This is how Dai is entered into circulation and how users gain access to liquidity. Others obtain Dai by buying it from brokers or exchanges, or simply by receiving it as a means of payment.\\n\\nEvery Dai in circulation is directly backed by excess collateral, meaning that the value of the collateral is higher than the value of the Dai debt, and all Dai transactions are publicly viewable on the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nIt is important to differentiate between Multi-Collateral DAI and Single-Collateral DAI (SAI), an earlier version of the token that could only be collateralized by a single cryptocurrency; SAI also doesn’t support the DAI Savings Rate, which allows users to earn interest by holding DAI tokens.\\n\\n18.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nDAI is created out of loans made by the platform to the users. The interest on these loans is paid through the stability fee. This stability fee should not be confused with a maintenance fee or service fee for using the Maker Vault. It is clear that the crypto deposits are used as collateral for borrowing DAI. Hence, if the collateralization ratio drops below 150% the trader’s collateral will be liquidated to pay off their loan.\\n\\nIn this way, DAI is created out of an interest-based loan (transaction). Interest-based loans or transactions are not Shariah-compliant.\\n\\n18.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBased on the above discussion, DAI is not Shariah-compliant. Therefore, it is not allowed to transact with or deal in it.\\n\\n19.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'DAI', 'Official Website': 'https://makerdao.com/ru/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai', 'Reviewer': '', 'Review Date': ''}), Document(page_content=\"Monero\\n\\nWhitepaper link\\n\\nhttps://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/blob/master/whitepaper/whitepaper.pdf\\n\\nDr Farrukh Habib\\n\\n25 October 2023\\n\\nReview Expiry:\\n\\n24 October 2024\\n\\n19.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n19.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\n\\tMonero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was created in 2014. It is based on the CryptoNote protocol, which uses several techniques to protect user privacy, including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and CoinJoin.\\n\\n\\tThe main objective of Monero is to provide a cryptocurrency that is both private and secure. The protocol is designed to be resistant to government surveillance and censorship. Monero is also designed to be scalable, so that it can be used by many people.\\n\\n19.1.2. The Token\\n\\n\\tThe Monero token (XMR) is the native cryptocurrency of the Monero network. It is used to pay for transactions on the network, to secure the network through mining, and to participate in governance.\\n\\n\\tXMR is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency. This means that it is mined by solving computationally difficult problems. The network is secured by a network of miners who compete to solve these problems.\\n\\n\\tXMR holders can also participate in governance by voting on proposals that affect the Monero network. These proposals can include changes to the network's protocol, the distribution of rewards, and other matters.\\n\\n19.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n\\tThe Monero protocol is a decentralized platform that allows users to send and receive Monero tokens without revealing their identity. It is designed to be secure, private, and scalable.\\n\\n\\tFrom a Shariah perspective, it does not directly involve any prohibited activities, such as interest, gambling, or excessive uncertainty. The protocol is also decentralized, which means that it is not subject to the control of any single entity. This makes it a more secure and trustworthy platform for conducting transactions.\\n\\n\\tThe Monero token (XMR) is a utility token that is used to pay for fees on the Monero network, to secure the network through mining, and to participate in governance.\\n\\n\\tFrom a Shariah perspective, it is not a security or a derivative, and it does not represent any ownership interest in the Monero network. XMR is simply a tool that can be used to participate in the network and earn rewards.\\n\\n\\tSome people argue that Monero could be, and has been, used for illegal activities, such as, payment for illegal goods and services, money laundering and terrorist financing. Based on that the use of Monero for such purposes is definitely not Shariah-compliant, and such transactions and activities would be invalid and impermissible from the Shariah perspective. But it does not make Monero token itself a haram subject matter or object because these activities or transactions are not an integral part or component of the protocol itself.\\n\\n19.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n\\tBased on the above analysis, the Monero protocol and token both can be considered halal if they are used in a Shariah-compliant manner. They are decentralized platforms that do not directly involve any prohibited activities.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n20.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nTRON is an open source public blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. TRON is compatible with Ethereum, which means that you can migrate smart contracts on Ethereum to TRON directly or with minor modifications. TRON relies on a unique consensus mechanism to realize the high TPS of the TRON network that is far beyond Ethereum, bringing developers a good experience of a faster transaction.\\n\\nTRON's consensus mechanism is DPOS. TRON supports Http and gRPC APIs, and TRON also provides Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC 2.0 APIs.\\n\\nTRON network transactions need to pay bandwidth and energy fees, where bandwidth is a unit to measure the size of a transaction in bytes. The larger the transaction, the more bandwidth resources will be consumed. Energy is a unit that measures the amount of computation required for TVM to perform specific operations on the TRON network. Energy is calculated in the same way as Ethereum. The more instructions a transaction executes, the more energy it consumes, and the amount of energy consumed by different instructions are different.\\n\\n20.1.2. The Token\\n\\nTRX is the most important cryptocurrency on the TRON network and has a wide range of application scenarios. The rewards on the TRON network are issued in the form of TRX. Users can obtain resources and voting rights by staking TRX. TRX is also used as primary form of collateral in the DeFi lending market, as a unit of account in NFT marketplaces, and so on.\\n\\nTRX is minted when a Super Representative produces a block on the TRON network. Every transaction on TRON consumes bandwidth or energy. When a user's bandwidth or energy is insufficient, they need to burn TRX to pay for the resources required for the transaction. The burning of TRX can not only help reduce the inflation of TRX, but also prevent accidental or malicious transactions from occupying all TRON network resources.\\n\\n20.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Tron protocol is a decentralized blockchain network that is not owned or operated by any single entity. This makes it a Shariah-compliant platform, as it does not involve any interest-based transactions or other prohibited activities.\\n\\nThe Tron token is a digital asset that is not subject to inflation. It can be used to pay transaction fees on the Tron network, and it can also be used to hold value. The Tron token is a Shariah-compliant asset, as it does not involve any interest-based transactions or other prohibited activities.\\n\\n20.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n\\tThe Tron protocol and TRX are both Shariah-compliant. The Tron protocol is a decentralized blockchain network that does not involve any interest-based transactions or other prohibited activities. TRX is a digital asset that is not subject to inflation and can be used to pay transaction fees on the Tron network or hold value. Therefore, the Tron protocol and TRX are both permissible (halal) in Islam.\\n\\n21.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'TRX', 'Official Website': 'https://tron.network/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron', 'Reviewer': '', 'Review Date': ''}), Document(page_content=\"EOS (EOS)\\n\\nName of the Protocol\\n\\nEOS\\n\\n30 August 2023\\n\\n21.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n21.1.1. The Protocol:\\n\\nThe EOS protocol, also known as EOS.IO, is a blockchain-based platform designed to support high-throughput decentralized applications (DApps). It operates on a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) system, where block producers are elected by token holders. The protocol aims to provide a platform for developers to build decentralized applications, enable high-throughput and low latency transactions, and secure the network through DPoS. EOS.IO claims to eliminate transaction fees and can conduct millions of transactions per second. \\n\\n21.1.2. The Token:\\n\\nThe EOS token is the native cryptocurrency of the EOS network. Developers need only to hold EOS coins, rather than spending them, to use network resources and to build and run DApps. Token holders who aren't running apps can allocate or rent their bandwidth to others who need it. The EOS token is used for various purposes, including:\\n\\n- Paying for transaction fees.\\n\\n- Staking for block production.\\n\\n- Voting on network proposals.\\n\\n- Purchasing or renting access to network bandwidth and storage capacity on EOS.\\n\\n- Participating in DPoS network consensus and on-chain governance.\\n\\n- Accounting for value on native EOS-based applications.\\n\\n21.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe EOS Network is fundamentally a decentralized platform designed to facilitate the development and operation of decentralized applications. From a Shariah perspective, it can be seen as a digital platform or marketplace, akin to a virtual space where various activities can be conducted.\\n\\nThe primary objective of the EOS Network is to provide a reliable and efficient environment for developers and users. There's no inherent element in its design or function that contradicts Shariah principles.\\n\\nThe EOS token can be characterized as asset or property in Islamic jurisprudence. It holds value, can be traded, and is recognized by the community. Thus, it can be a subject matter of a transaction.\\n\\nAs a digital asset, it bears similarities to contractual rights or intangible assets in Islamic commercial law. Its value is derived from the demand and utility within the EOS ecosystem.\\n\\nPotential Shariah Concerns:\\n\\nInterest (Usury): There's no indication from the provided sources that the EOS token or the EOS Network inherently involves interest or usurious transactions.\\n\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): The basic function and design of the EOS token and network do not involve gambling. However, like any platform, it can potentially host applications that might involve gambling, which would be impermissible in Shariah.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (غرر): The inherent nature of the EOS token does not involve excessive uncertainty beyond the market risk of cryptos.\\n\\nUnethical or Immoral Activities: The EOS Network, being a decentralized platform, can host a wide range of applications. If any of these applications promote or involve unethical or immoral activities, they would be problematic from a Shariah perspective. However, the platform itself, in its foundational design, is neutral.\\n\\n21.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIn conclusion, the EOS Network, in its essence, is a digital platform that doesn't inherently contradict Shariah principles. The EOS token, as a digital asset with value and utility, can be seen as a valid property in Islamic law.\\n\\nThe permissibility of the protocol and tokens is also determined by their application and usage. Hence, the applications and activities conducted on the platform should be individually assessed for Shariah compliance. Moreover, users should also ensure that their interactions/transactions, such as trading, investment, and holding, with the protocol or token are aligned with Islamic principles as well.\\n\\n22.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'EOS', 'Official Website': 'https://eosnetwork.com/', 'Official Documentation Link': 'https://docs.eosnetwork.com/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos', 'Initial Assessment': 'Date', 'Report Expiry Date': '29 August 2024'}), Document(page_content='Stacks (STX)\\t\\n\\nName of the Protocol\\n\\nStacks\\n\\n30 August 2023\\n\\n22.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Stacks protocol aims to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) to Bitcoin, one of the most secure and widely used blockchains. It seeks to expand the functionality of Bitcoin beyond just a store of value or medium of exchange.\\n\\n22.1.1. The Protocol:\\n\\nThe protocol has the following mechanics:\\n\\nProof-of-Transfer (PoX): Stacks introduces a novel consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Transfer. Instead of miners spending electricity as in Proof-of-Work, they use Bitcoin to participate in the network. This mechanism ties the Stacks blockchain to Bitcoin\\'s security.\\n\\nSmart Contracts: With the Clarity smart contract language, developers can write predictable smart contracts, ensuring that the contract\\'s actions can be determined before execution. This is a departure from Turing-complete languages where outcomes can be uncertain until execution.\\n\\nDecentralized Identity: Stacks offers a decentralized identity solution, allowing users to have a single identity for DApps across the network, enhancing privacy and security.\\n\\n22.1.2. The Token:\\n\\nPrimary Usage:\\n\\nFuel for Smart Contracts: STX is used as \"gas\" to execute Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.\\n\\nStaking in PoX: Users can lock (or \"stack\") their STX to support network security and consensus. In return, they earn Bitcoin as a reward, leveraging the PoX mechanism.\\n\\nMain Functions:\\n\\nNetwork Participation: STX is essential for participating in the Stacks network, whether it\\'s for executing smart contracts, staking in PoX, or voting in governance proposals.\\n\\nEconomic Incentive: The token provides economic incentives to various network participants, ensuring the network remains secure and functional.\\n\\nUnique Features:\\n\\nEarn Bitcoin: One of the standout features of STX is the ability for holders to earn Bitcoin by staking. This ties the Stacks ecosystem closer to the Bitcoin network and provides a unique value proposition for STX holders.\\n\\nNon-Turing Complete Smart Contracts: The use of the Clarity language means that STX is tied to smart contracts that prioritize predictability and security over flexibility.\\n\\n22.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Stacks protocol, at its core, is a technological platform designed to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications to Bitcoin. From a Shariah perspective, it can be viewed as a digital platform or service, similar to other technological services or platforms. Its primary function is to provide a framework for decentralized applications and smart contracts, without any inherent elements that contradict Islamic principles.\\n\\nThe STX token can be characterized as \"مال متقوم\" (valid property or asset) in Islamic jurisprudence. It has utility, can be owned, and has value; hence, it can be a subject of trade and transactions. As with other cryptocurrencies, it can be likened to digital commodities or assets, and its trade can be equated to the trade of other permissible commodities, provided the transaction does not involve prohibited elements.\\n\\nProhibited Elements in Shariah:\\n\\nInterest (Usury/Riba): There\\'s no inherent design in the Stacks protocol or the STX token that promotes or involves interest-based transactions.\\n\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): The protocol and token do not inherently promote gambling. However, it\\'s worth noting that any platform can potentially host applications that might involve gambling. It\\'s the responsibility of users to avoid such applications.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (غرر): While cryptocurrencies, in general, are volatile, this volatility is a market-driven factor and not an inherent design of the STX token. As such, the normal volatility does not constitute the prohibited excessive uncertainty in Islamic jurisprudence.\\n\\nUnethical or Immoral Activities: The protocol itself is neutral. However, like any technology, it can be used for both ethical and unethical purposes. Users and developers should ensure that the applications they build or engage with on the Stacks platform adhere to ethical and Shariah-compliant standards.\\n\\n22.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIn conclusion, from a foundational perspective, the Stacks protocol and the STX token do not inherently possess elements prohibited in Shariah. The STX token, as a digital asset with value and utility, can be seen as a valid property in Islamic law.\\n\\nThe permissibility of the protocol and tokens is also determined by their application and usage. Hence, the applications and activities conducted on the platform should be individually assessed for Shariah compliance. Moreover, users should also ensure that their interactions/transactions, such as trading, investment, and holding, with the protocol or token are aligned with Islamic principles as well.\\n\\n23.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'STX', 'Official Website': 'https://www.stacks.co/', 'Official Documentation Link': 'https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1AxyPunHHAHiEffXWESKfbvmBpGQv138Fp/stacks.pdf; https://www.stacks.co/learn/introduction', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stacks', 'Initial Assessment': 'Date', 'Report Expiry Date': '29 August 2024'}), Document(page_content=\"MultiversX (EGLD)\\n\\nName of the Protocol\\n\\nMultiversX\\n\\n30 August 2023\\n\\n23.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nMultiversX is a decentralized protocol that aims to provide a comprehensive solution for the creation, management, and trading of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). The protocol is designed to be blockchain-agnostic, meaning it can operate across multiple blockchains, ensuring flexibility and wider reach.\\n\\n23.1.1. The Protocol:\\n\\nIt mainly has NFT minting tools and DEX for NFTs. Its main objectives are:\\n\\nNFT Creation and Management: MultiversX offers tools and features that allow users to create, manage, and trade NFTs seamlessly. This includes the ability to mint NFTs, set up royalties, and manage metadata.\\n\\nCross-Chain Interoperability: One of the standout features of MultiversX is its blockchain-agnostic nature. This ensures that NFTs created on one blockchain can be moved, traded, or utilized on another, breaking the barriers of individual blockchain ecosystems.\\n\\nDecentralized Marketplace: MultiversX provides a decentralized marketplace where users can list, buy, and sell NFTs. This marketplace is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and efficient.\\n\\n23.1.2. The Token:\\n\\nThe MVX token is the native utility token of the MultiversX protocol. It plays a central role in the ecosystem, facilitating various operations and providing incentives.\\n\\nPrimary Usage:\\n\\nGovernance: MVX token holders have the power to propose and vote on protocol upgrades, changes, and other governance-related matters. This ensures that the community has a say in the direction and development of the protocol.\\n\\nStaking: Users can stake MVX tokens to earn rewards. Staking also plays a role in securing the network and ensuring its smooth operation.\\n\\nPayment: MVX tokens can be used to pay for various services within the MultiversX ecosystem, such as minting fees, listing fees, and other transaction costs.\\n\\n23.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n1. Shariah Nature of the MultiversX Protocol:\\n\\nThe MultiversX protocol primarily focuses on the creation, management, and trading of NFTs in a decentralized manner. From a Shariah perspective, the act of creating and trading assets, including digital ones, is permissible as long as the assets have clear ownership and are not associated with prohibited activities.\\n\\nIslamic Legal Characterization: The protocol can be characterized as a digital marketplace or platform (سوق إلكتروني) that facilitates trade and transactions. As long as the items being traded (NFTs) are Shariah-compliant and the trade is conducted fairly without deception, the platform's operations align with Islamic commercial principles.\\n\\n2. Islamic Legal Characterization of the MVX Token:\\n\\nThe MVX token serves multiple functions, including governance, staking, and payment within the MultiversX ecosystem.\\n\\nShariah Nature: The MVX token can be viewed as a digital asset or property (مال متقوم) that holds value and can be traded. As long as the token is not used for prohibited activities and its primary functions do not violate Shariah principles, it can be considered a valid subject matter of a transaction.\\n\\n3. Prohibited Elements in the Protocol or Token:\\n\\nInterest (Usury): There's no indication from the provided information that the protocol or the token inherently involves interest-based transactions.\\n\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): The primary functions of the protocol and token do not involve gambling. However, any speculative trading or using the token in games of chance would be considered non-compliant.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (غرر): While the crypto market is volatile, this volatility, as mentioned, is a business risk and not the kind of excessive uncertainty prohibited in Shariah. The protocol's main functions do not seem to introduce inherent uncertainties.\\n\\nUnethical or Immoral Activities: The protocol itself is a tool, and its Shariah compliance depends on how it's used. If NFTs representing prohibited content were traded, that would be non-compliant. Users and creators should ensure that the content of NFTs aligns with Islamic ethics.\\n\\n23.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIn conclusion, the MultiversX protocol and MVX token, in their core design and functions, do not appear to have elements that are inherently prohibited in Shariah. However, the actual Shariah compliance of activities on the platform would depend on the nature of the NFTs being traded and how the token is used.\\n\\nMoreover, users should also ensure that their interactions/transactions, such as trading, investment, and holding, with the protocol or token are aligned with Islamic principles as well.\\n\\n24.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'EGLD', 'Official Website': 'https://multiversx.com/', 'Official Documentation Link': 'https://files.multiversx.com/multiversx-whitepaper.pdf; https://docs.multiversx.com/welcome/welcome-to-multiversx', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multiversx-egld/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/multiversx', 'Initial Assessment': 'Date', 'Report Expiry Date': '29 August 2024'}), Document(page_content='Pax Dollar (USDP)\\n\\nName of the Protocol\\n\\nPax Dollar\\n\\n30 August 2023\\n\\n24.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n1. Protocol Description:\\n\\nObjective: Paxos aims to modernize finance by mobilizing assets at the speed of the internet. The company\\'s mission is to enable the movement of any assets, anytime, anywhere in a trustworthy manner. Paxos is a regulated financial institution that digitizes and mobilizes assets.\\n\\nMechanics: Paxos operates as a trust company, meaning it is a regulated entity that can hold customer funds. It has received a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services, which allows it to offer its services in a compliant manner. The company uses blockchain technology to ensure that all transactions are transparent, immutable, and secure.\\n\\nProducts/Applications: Beyond the USDP stablecoin, Paxos offers a suite of products including crypto trading services, custody solutions, and private blockchains for financial institutions. They also provide solutions for PayPal and Revolut, enabling these platforms to offer crypto services to their users.\\n\\n2. Token Description (USDP):\\n\\nPrimary Usage: USDP, formerly known as PAX or Paxos Standard, is a stablecoin that is pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. This means that for every USDP token in circulation, there is a corresponding US dollar held in reserve by Paxos. The primary use of USDP is to offer a stable digital asset that can be used in the volatile crypto markets. It provides a digital equivalent to the US dollar on the blockchain.\\n\\nMain Functions:\\n\\nStability: USDP offers a refuge from the often-volatile crypto markets. Traders and investors can convert their assets into USDP during times of high volatility to preserve value.\\n\\nTransparency: Every USDP token is backed by a corresponding US dollar, and the reserves are regularly audited to ensure transparency and trust.\\n\\nInstant Transactions: USDP can be transferred between any two parties instantly, providing a fast method of transferring a stable value across the globe.\\n\\nRedemption: Users can always redeem USDP for the equivalent amount in US dollars, ensuring that the token maintains its peg.\\n\\nUnique Features:\\n\\nRegulated: Paxos, the company behind USDP, operates with a charter from the NYDFS, making it one of the few regulated entities in the crypto space.\\n\\nAudited Reserves: The reserves backing USDP are regularly audited by external firms, ensuring transparency and trust in the token\\'s value.\\n\\nIntegration with Traditional Finance: Paxos bridges the gap between traditional finance and the digital world, offering products that are familiar to financial institutions while leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology.\\n\\n24.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n1. Shariah Nature of the Platform or Protocol:\\n\\nPaxos operates as a trust company, ensuring that every USDP token is backed by a corresponding US dollar. From a Shariah perspective, the nature of the platform aligns with the principles of trustworthiness and transparency. The platform\\'s primary function is to provide a stable digital representation of a physical asset (the US dollar).\\n\\n2. Islamic Legal Characterization of the Token:\\n\\nThe USDP token represents a digital equivalent of a tangible asset, the US dollar. In Shariah, this can be seen as a form of \"مال متقوم\" (valid property or asset). The token acts as a digital certificate of ownership or claim on the USD in the reserves.\\n\\n3. Prohibited Elements in Shariah:\\n\\nInterest (Usury): Paxos does not offer interest on the USDP token, and its primary function is not to generate profit through lending or borrowing, making it free from the element of \"Riba\" (usury).\\n\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): The USDP token is not designed for speculative purposes, and its value is stable, pegged to the US dollar. Thus, it does not involve elements of gambling or excessive speculation.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (غرر): While the general crypto market can be volatile, USDP is a stablecoin, and its value remains consistent with the US dollar. The inherent design of USDP ensures that it does not have excessive uncertainty by its nature. External market factors affecting other cryptocurrencies do not impact USDP in the same way.\\n\\nUnethical or Immoral Activities: Paxos operates within a regulated framework and emphasizes transparency and compliance.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n28.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nArbitrum is a suite of Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solutions designed to scale Ethereum. Its primary goal is to make transactions on Ethereum faster and cheaper. The protocol allows for the execution of all activities one would typically do on Ethereum, such as deploying smart contracts and using Web3 applications.\\n\\nMechanics and Products:\\n\\nArbitrum Rollup: This is the flagship product of Arbitrum. It\\'s an Optimistic rollup protocol that inherits Ethereum-level security. The Rollup chain runs as a sub-module within Ethereum. Instead of requiring Ethereum nodes to process every transaction, Ethereum optimistically assumes that activities on Arbitrum are following the proper rules. If a violation occurs, it can be disputed back on L1 (Layer 1), ensuring that fraud will be proven, the invalid claim disregarded, and the malicious party penalized.\\n\\nArbitrum AnyTrust: Unlike the Rollup, AnyTrust chains don\\'t have the same decentralization or trustlessness. They offer lower fees because they manage data off-chain. In the case of a challenge, an AnyTrust chain reverts back to “rollup mode”. The security assumption here is that at least 2 of the committee members are honest.\\n\\nArbitrum Orbit: This allows users to launch their own chain into an interconnected universe of customizable chains that settle to Arbitrum One or Nova.\\n\\nArbitrum Nitro: This is the technical stack that powers all Arbitrum products. It uses a fork of Geth, the most widely used Ethereum implementation, with modifications to transform it into a trustless layer 2.\\n\\n28.1.2. The Token\\xa0\\n\\nThere isn\\'t a specific mention of an \"Arbitrum Token.\" However, considering the context of the Arbitrum ecosystem, it\\'s likely that there are tokens associated with the platform, especially for governance or staking purposes. Tokens in such Layer-2 solutions typically serve as governance tokens, staking tokens, or utility tokens to pay for transaction fees or incentivize validators.\\n\\n28.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nArbitrum, as a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is fundamentally a technological tool designed to enhance the efficiency of blockchain transactions. From a Shariah perspective, tools and technologies that facilitate business or transactions are generally considered neutral. Their permissibility is often contingent upon their usage.\\n\\nThe protocol operates based on predefined rules and smart contracts. As long as these contracts do not contain elements that are explicitly prohibited in Islam, such as unjust enrichment or exploitation, they can be seen as permissible.\\n\\nPotential Shariah Concerns:\\n\\nInterest (Usury): There\\'s no indication from the provided information that the Arbitrum protocol or its associated token inherently involves interest-bearing transactions.\\n\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): The primary function of Arbitrum is to enhance transaction efficiency on Ethereum. It doesn\\'t seem to involve any gambling elements.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (غرر): The key concern would be if the token or protocol intentionally introduces uncertainty or ambiguity, which doesn\\'t seem to be the case for Arbitrum.\\n\\nUnethical or Immoral Activities: The protocol\\'s primary purpose is technological. However, like any technology, its permissibility would be contingent upon its use. If it\\'s used to facilitate prohibited activities, then such usage would be impermissible.\\n\\n28.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIn conclusion, from a Shariah perspective, the Arbitrum protocol, being a technological tool, is neutral. The token, if it represents a clear value and purpose, can be considered a valid property in Islamic jurisprudence. Therefore, they are shariah compliant.

Its primary goal is to allow for cross-border transactions between any pair of currencies. This includes facilitating microtransactions and remittances, mobile branches, and mobile money services.\\n\\nStellar operates using a consensus algorithm rather than mining, which means faster transaction times and less energy consumption. It uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which is an alternative to proof-of-work and provides decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security.\\n\\nStellar\\'s main product is its platform that allows for the creation of custom ICOs. It also offers a decentralized exchange where its digital currency, Lumens (XLM), can be traded.\\n\\n31.1.2. The Token\\xa0\\n\\nLumens (XLM) are the native asset of the Stellar network. Lumens are used to facilitate multi-currency transactions and act as a bridge between different currencies on the Stellar network. They also serve as an anti-spam role in the network. Each transaction has a minor fee (0.00001 XLM) associated with it, which prevents users with malicious intentions from flooding the network (DoS attacks).\\n\\nStellar\\'s consensus protocol ensures that transactions are swift and efficient.\\n\\nLumens can be used in a variety of financial services, including remittances, mobile money, and micropayments.\\n\\nStellar offers a decentralized exchange where XLM can be traded for other assets.\\n\\n31.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Stellar protocol, at its core, is a technological platform designed to facilitate cross-border transactions and remittances. From a Shariah perspective, the platform can be seen as a tool or medium (وسيلة) to facilitate trade and transactions.\\n\\nThe essence of facilitating trade and transactions is permissible (مباح) in Islam as long as the underlying transactions do not involve anything prohibited.\\n\\nLumens (XLM) can be characterized as \"مال متقوم\" (valid property) in Islamic jurisprudence. For an asset to be considered valid property, it should possess value and utility. Lumens, being the native asset of the Stellar network, have both value (as they can be traded for other assets or fiat currencies) and utility (as they facilitate transactions on the Stellar network). Therefore, they can be considered a subject matter of a transaction.\\n\\nInterest (Usury) (ربا): The Stellar protocol itself does not inherently involve interest or usury. However, if the platform is used to facilitate transactions that involve interest, such as lending and borrowing with interest, it would be against Shariah principles.\\n\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): The protocol does not inherently promote gambling. However, if tokens or assets created on the Stellar platform are used for gambling purposes, then such activities would be non-compliant with Shariah.\\n\\nUnethical or Immoral Activities: The Stellar protocol, in its essence, is neutral.

Bitcoin Cash\\'s vision is to bring sound money to the world, fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin as \"Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash.\"\\n\\nBitcoin Cash operates on a decentralized network of nodes. It increased the block size limit, allowing more transactions to be processed in each block. This change aims to make the network faster and more scalable.\\n\\nUnique Features:\\n\\nLow Fees: Bitcoin Cash transactions typically have lower fees compared to Bitcoin, making it more suitable for everyday transactions.\\n\\nFast Transactions: Due to the increased block size, BCH can process more transactions quickly.\\n\\nDecentralized Development: Multiple independent teams provide software implementations, ensuring no single group or project can control Bitcoin Cash.\\n\\n33.1.2. The Token\\xa0\\n\\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Bitcoin Cash network. It is used for peer-to-peer transactions, both large and small, across the globe. It can also be used for merchant payments.\\n\\n33.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBitcoin Cash, as a decentralized blockchain protocol, is fundamentally a technological tool designed to facilitate peer-to-peer electronic transactions. In Islamic jurisprudence, tools or platforms of this nature are typically viewed as neutral (مباح).\\n\\nBCH, being a digital asset with intrinsic value and utility, can be seen as \"valid property\" (مال متقوم) in Islamic jurisprudence. It serves as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.\\n\\nProhibited Elements in Shariah:\\n\\nInterest (Usury) (ربا): The Bitcoin Cash protocol and BCH token do not inherently involve or promote interest-based transactions.\\n\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): Neither the protocol nor the token inherently promotes gambling. However, users should be cautious about how they use BCH to ensure they don\\'t engage in gambling activities.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (غرر): While cryptocurrencies are volatile, this volatility is akin to business risk, which is permissible in Islam. The protocol or token does not introduce other forms of excessive uncertainty.\\n\\nUnethical or Immoral Activities: The decentralized nature of Bitcoin Cash means it can be used for various purposes. Users should ensure their use aligns with Islamic ethical standards.\\n\\n33.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIn conclusion, from a Shariah perspective, the Bitcoin Cash protocol and BCH token are tools; and hence, they are Shariah compliant. However, the permissibility is also determined by their application. Users should ensure their interactions, such as trading, investment, and holding, align with Islamic principles.\\n\\n34.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'BCH', 'Official Website': 'https://bch.info/en/; https://bitcoincash.org/;', 'Official Documentation Link': 'CoinMarketCap Link:', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash', 'Initial Assessment': 'Date', 'Report Expiry Date': '29 August 2024'}), Document(page_content='Filecoin (FIL)\\n\\nName of the Protocol\\xa0\\n\\nFilecoin\\n\\n30 August 2023\\n\\n34.1.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n35.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nThe Golden Protocol is a decentralized, permissionless knowledge graph that aims to map 10 billion entities and the public knowledge that surrounds them. Its mission is to create an open, free, and incentivized graph of canonical knowledge, recognized as accurate and authoritative\\u200b\\u200b. The protocol functions by using triples (also known as fact triples or SPO triples), which are the building blocks of facts that link entities together forming a graph\\u200b. The protocol also incentivizes the construction of the knowledge graph by offering rewards in the form of testnet points to users who successfully submit and verify triples. It\\'s important to note that the protocol is still under development and currently operates on a testnet, with a mainnet launch planned for the future\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\n35.1.2. The Token\\n\\nAs for the token, it is not explicitly described in the available documents. It seems that the protocol is using a placeholder called \"testnet points\" that participants can earn for contributing to the development of the graph by submitting and verifying triples. These points may convert into incentives available at the mainnet launch\\u200b. However, as of now, there\\'s no mainnet incentive and no set date for release for any incentives\\u200b. The documents state that up to 1% of the token treasury will be awarded to the community for correct data submission and verification\\u200b.\\n\\n35.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nFrom an Islamic legal perspective, the nature of the platform can be seen as a digital, decentralized, open-source protocol aiming to build a global knowledge graph. It offers a service of knowledge collection and verification, which does not appear to involve any elements prohibited by Shariah law, such as interest (usury), gambling, excessive uncertainty, or unethical activities.\\n\\nThe token, as described, is a form of digital asset or incentive that is awarded to users for their contribution to the protocol. While the specifics of the token are not yet outlined, based on the information available, it seems that it would be considered a form of reward or compensation for work done (in this case, submitting and verifying triples). This is generally permissible in Shariah, as it can be seen as a form of contract (عقد) where work is exchanged for compensation.\\n\\n35.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBased on the available information, the Golden Protocol appears to be halal (permissible) as it doesn\\'t involve any activities that are explicitly prohibited in Shariah. The objective of the protocol is to build a knowledge graph, which is a form of permissible service and doesn\\'t involve elements such as gambling, interest, or unethical activities.\\n\\nAs for the token, it appears to be halal as well, as it is given as a reward or compensation for work done, which is generally permissible in Shariah. However, it\\'s important to note that the details of the token are still not fully outlined, and a more comprehensive Shariah review may be needed once more information is available.\\n\\n36.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Official Website:', 'Official Documentation Link': 'https://docs.golden.xyz/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'Initial Assessment', 'Initial Assessment': 'Date', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee', 'Review Date': '27 May 2023'}), Document(page_content=\"Kresko\\n\\nName of the Protocol\\xa0\\n\\nKresko\\n\\nhttps://www.kresko.fi/\\n\\nhttps://github.com/kreskohq/kresko-protocol/blob/main/whitepaper/Kresko%20Synthetic%20Asset%20Protocol%20v1_2023-01-23.pdf\\n\\nCoinMarketCap Link:\\xa0\\n\\nDr Farrukh Habib\\xa0\\n\\n27 May 2023\\n\\n36.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n36.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nKresko is a non-custodial, capital-efficient synthetic asset protocol that operates on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It enables the creation and management of securely collateralized synthetic assets through smart contracts written in Solidity. Users can deposit various collateral assets, which are combined in value, allowing users to borrow synthetic assets referred to as Kresko Assets in an overcollateralized fashion. Users can also participate in the protocol by performing liquidations on unhealthy debt positions.\\n\\nThese synthetic assets reflect the value of the underlying asset and are connected within the protocol to an oracle feed that transmits fresh market information of the underlying asset. This is instantly reflected in the protocol\\u200b. Examples of Kresko Asset types include stocks, commodities, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and synthetic crypto assets\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nThe Kresko platform's architecture is designed to grow and evolve according to the vision of the Kresko community. It facilitates trade in synthetic stocks, commodities, and crypto, and allows fractional trading. Its design aims to manage all DeFi assets — mint, swap, pool, and farm — in one place, showing portfolio health and risk clearly.\\n\\n36.1.2. The Token\\n\\nThe documents provided do not explicitly describe a specific Kresko token or coin. However, the synthetic assets created using the Kresko protocol, known as Kresko Assets or krAssets, could be considered as tokens in this context. These krAssets are 18-decimal precision ERC-20 tokens that reflect the value of an underlying asset. These tokens offer a permissionless way to invest or speculate on the value of the underlying asset with minimal counterparty risk.\\n\\n36.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIn general, Kresko Protocol appears to function as a platform for contractual agreements relating to the conventional deposit, interest-based borrowing, and trading of synthetic assets. As such, it can be seen as a tool or mechanism facilitating those trades and conventional financial transactions, which in itself is inherently contrary to Shariah principles. Moreover, the permissibility of each transaction is also dependent on the specifics of the transaction and the nature of the assets involved which are mixed in this case.\\n\\nIn other words, the synthetic assets themselves are questionable. If these assets represent things that are haram, or if they involve excessive uncertainty or speculation, this could potentially be a concern from a Shariah perspective.\\n\\nThe Kresko tokens seem to represent a claim or right to a portion of the collateralized assets within the protocol which are used for interest-based loans or transactions. If this is accurate, the token could potentially be characterized as a form of conventional debt or financial obligation.\\n\\n36.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, it can be said that the protocol and tokens are not Shariah compliant (haram). They cannot be used in a valid transaction.\\n\\n37.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Official Website:', 'Official Documentation Link': 'https://kresko.gitbook.io/kresko-docs/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'Initial Assessment', 'Initial Assessment': 'Date', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee', 'Review Date': '27 May 2023'}), Document(page_content=\"Aleo\\n\\nName of the Protocol\\xa0\\n\\nAleo\\n\\nhttps://www.aleo.org/\\n\\nOfficial Docs Link:\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://developer.aleo.org/getting_started/\\n\\nCoinMarketCap Link:\\xa0\\n\\nDr Farrukh Habib\\xa0\\n\\n27 May 2023\\n\\n37.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n37.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nAleo is a privacy-focused blockchain platform designed to enable fully private applications. Its key objective is to facilitate the development of decentralized, private applications (dApps) that allow users to interact in a secure, private manner. Aleo achieves this privacy using a technology called zero-knowledge proofs, which allow someone to verify the truth of a statement without revealing any information about the statement itself.\\n\\nAleo's main products include Aleo Studio, a web IDE for creating private applications, and SnarkOS, the node implementation of the Aleo protocol. SnarkOS is a decentralized operating system that powers the Aleo network. It is designed to be efficient and scalable, with a focus on minimizing storage, computation, and network requirements.\\n\\nAleo employs a unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of Succinct Work (PoSW), which combines elements of Proof of Work (PoW) and succinct zero-knowledge proofs. This mechanism ensures that the blockchain is maintained in a decentralized, secure, and efficient manner.\\n\\n37.1.2. The Token\\n\\nThere is no specific information available about the token. It seems that this protocol does not have a token, at least not now.\\n\\n37.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nFrom a Shariah perspective, Aleo appears to be a technology platform that enables the creation of private applications. As such, it does not seem to inherently violate any of the key principles of Shariah. It also does not seem that it is fundamentally used for unethical or immoral activities. However, it is important to note that the use of the platform for specific activities would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for the Shariah compliance of that specific case.\\n\\nWithout specific details about the Aleo token, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive Shariah evaluation. However, if the token serves as a utility or a means of exchange within the Aleo ecosystem and does not involve elements of interest, excessive uncertainty, or gambling, it could potentially be seen as permissible from a Shariah perspective. Again, its specific use cases would need to be evaluated individually.\\n\\n37.3.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n38.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nBurnt Finance is a fully decentralized auction protocol built on Solana, a high-performance blockchain known for its speed and low transaction costs\\u200b\\u200b. Burnt Finance\\'s primary goal is to enable anyone to mint a diverse range of synthetics and NFTs and provide them with an unparalleled auction platform that supports various major auction types, ranging from English to Dutch. The platform can process up to 50,000 transactions per second within a 400ms block time, significantly reducing the opportunity for bid manipulation. The average transaction fees are approximately $0.00005, which effectively removes the friction caused by gas fees.\\n\\n38.1.2. The Token\\n\\nThe Burnt Token (BURNT) is the native digital, cryptographically secured utility token of the Burnt Finance platform. BURNT is designed to be used as an interoperable utility token exclusively on the platform. It functions as the medium of exchange between participants on the Burnt Finance platform and does not represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in any entity. The issuance of BURNT aims to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants interacting within the ecosystem on the Burnt Finance platform\\u200b.\\n\\nThe BURNT token has several use cases. It allows holders to propose and vote on governance proposals determining the features and parameters of the Burnt Finance platform. This governance mechanism includes protocol upgrades, profile verification, and synthetic asset creation. BURNT can be used as collateral for minting synthetic Burnt Assets (bAssets) on the platform, which can then be transferred and traded. Users who purchase NFTs on the platform using BURNT enjoy reduced transaction fees. BURNT also functions as economic incentives distributed to encourage users to contribute and maintain the ecosystem on the Burnt Finance platform.\\n\\nThe Burnt Finance platform uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) security, relying on third-party computing resources to maintain protocol security. BURNT is distributed as the native platform currency to quantify and pay the costs of consumed resources.\\n\\n38.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nFrom an Islamic legal perspective, the Burnt Finance platform can be viewed as a marketplace or a trading platform. It facilitates transactions between users who are looking to auction or buy assets, like a traditional auction house or a marketplace.\\n\\nThe platform itself does not seem to engage in any activities that are explicitly prohibited in Shariah. There are no elements of Riba (usury or interest), Gharar (excessive uncertainty), Maysir (gambling), or any unethical or immoral activities apparent in the basic operation of the platform.\\n\\nHowever, the items being traded on the platform could potentially be problematic from a Shariah perspective. For example, if the NFTs or synthetic assets being auctioned and traded involve elements prohibited in Islam such as haram imagery or themes, then participating in these specific transactions could be seen as haram. Therefore, the permissibility of using the platform from a Shariah perspective may largely depend on the nature of the individual assets being traded.\\n\\nBURNT token can be seen as a form of \"Thaman\" (price or consideration) used in transactions within the Burnt Finance platform, similar to how money is used in traditional transactions. It can be seen as a valid subject matter of a transaction (\"Mal Mutaqawwam\") as long as it has perceived value among the users of the platform and can be exchanged for goods or services.\\n\\nBURNT does not seem to contain elements that are explicitly prohibited in Shariah, such as Riba or Maysir. It is used as a medium of exchange, a means of voting on governance proposals, and a way to incentivize participation in the platform. It does not represent a debt, does not accrue interest, and does not entitle the holder to profits or returns. It is also not used for gambling purposes.\\n\\n38.3.

It is a Layer-2 scaling solution that can be used to execute Ethereum smart contracts off-chain and settle transactions on-chain.\\n\\nzkSync is designed to be secure, scalable, and user-friendly. It uses zkSNARKs, a type of zero-knowledge proof, to verify transactions off-chain without revealing any sensitive information. This allows zkSync to achieve high throughput and low fees while maintaining the security and decentralization of Ethereum.\\n\\nzkSync is still under development, but it has already achieved significant milestones. In March 2023, zkSync launched its public testnet, which allowed users to test the protocol and provide feedback.

Sui's main objectives are to:\\n\\n\\tProvide a decentralized platform for developers to build applications.\\n\\n\\tEnable secure and efficient transactions.\\n\\n\\tReduce the environmental impact of blockchain technology.\\n\\nSui offers scalability and unprecedented low-latency for simple use cases. Sui makes most transactions processable in parallel. This better utilizes processing resources and offers the option to increase throughput by adding more resources. Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for simple use cases, such as payment transactions and assets transfer.\\n\\n39.1.1. The Token\\n\\nSui has a native token called SUI, with a fixed supply. The SUI token is used to pay for gas, and users can stake their SUI tokens with validators in a Delegated Proof-of-Stake model within an epoch. The voting power of validators within this epoch is a function of the amount of SUI in their staking pool, including both validator and user SUI tokens. In any epoch, the set of validators is Byzantine fault tolerant. At the end of the epoch, fees collected through all transactions processed are distributed to validators according to their contribution to the operation of the network. Validators can in turn share some of the fees as rewards to users that stake their SUI with them.\\n\\nThe SUI token serves four purposes on the Sui platform:\\n\\nUsers can stake SUI to participate in the proof-of-stake mechanism.\\n\\nSUI is the asset denomination needed for paying the gas fees required to execute and store transactions or other operations on the Sui platform.\\n\\nSUI can be used as a versatile and liquid asset for various applications including the standard features of money – a unit of account, a medium of exchange, or a store of value – and more complex functionality enabled by smart contracts, interoperability, and composability across the Sui ecosystem.\\n\\nSUI token plays an important role in governance by acting as a right to participate in on-chain voting on issues such as protocol upgrades.\\n\\n39.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Shariah nature of the Sui protocol is that it is a decentralized platform that allows users to send and receive value without the need for a central authority.\\n\\nThe Islamic legal characterization of the Sui token is that it is a digital asset that can be used to pay for transactions, secure the network, and participate in governance. SUI is a limited supply token, which means that it has a fixed value and cannot be inflated.\\n\\nThere are no major elements or vital components in the Sui protocol or token that are prohibited in Shariah.

The protocol is designed to be lightweight and efficient, and it can be used to send messages between any two chains that are connected to the LayerZero network.\\n\\nThe LayerZero protocol is based on a two-party model. Each chain that wants to connect to the LayerZero network must run an endpoint. The endpoints are responsible for routing messages between the different chains.\\n\\nWhen a message is sent from one chain to another, it is first routed through the endpoint on the sending chain. The endpoint then notifies the Oracle and Relayer of the message and its destination chain. The Oracle forwards the block header to the endpoint on the receiving chain, and the Relayer then submits the transaction proof.\\n\\nThe LayerZero protocol is designed to be secure and reliable. The messages are encrypted and signed, and the Oracle and Relayer are both incentivized to ensure that the messages are delivered correctly.\\n\\n40.1.2.

They use a technology called STARKs to generate and verify proofs of computational integrity. STARKs are zero-knowledge, succinct, transparent, and post-quantum secure. This means that they can be used to prove that a computation has been performed without revealing any information about the input or output of that computation.\\n\\nStarkWare's technology can be used to scale blockchains by offloading computations to off-chain servers. This allows for more transactions to be processed per second without increasing the computational burden on the blockchain itself. StarkWare's technology can also be used to provide privacy for blockchain transactions. This is done by encrypting the data before it is processed on the blockchain. Only the parties involved in the transaction can decrypt the data, which prevents anyone else from seeing it.\\n\\n StarkWare offers a few key products:\\n\\nStarkEx: A Standalone Validity-Rollup SaaS where decentralized applications (dApps) can build on the service. StarkEx supports a range of use cases such as NFT minting & trading, derivative trading, automated market making (AMM), spot trading, payments, and DeFi pooling\\u200b.\\n\\nStarkNet: A decentralized Validity-Rollup (also known as a ZK-Rollup) that acts as a Layer 2 network over Ethereum.

The use of Cairo for creating provable programs doesn't involve any forbidden activities in itself, but the nature of the programs could vary widely.\\n\\nThe project doesn't have a native token, so there's no token to evaluate for Shariah compliance. However, any token or asset used or created on the StarkWare protocols would need to be evaluated on its own terms.\\n\\n41.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIn conclusion, StarkWare's protocols (StarkEx and StarkNet) can be seen as tools and infrastructures that, in themselves, do not contravene any principles of Shariah law. Hence, they are halal (permissible).

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n42.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nNeon is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that functions within the Solana blockchain. The primary goal of Neon is to bring the scalability and low transaction costs of Solana to the Ethereum dApp ecosystem, providing developers and end-users with a platform that is both efficient and cost-effective.\\n\\nThe Neon EVM is designed to be a fully Ethereum-compatible environment on Solana, supporting Ethereum accounts, signatures, tools, infrastructure, and ERC-20 tokens, along with the Ethereum-like Web3 RPC API. This compatibility makes it possible to scale Ethereum dApps on Solana in a developer-friendly manner, allowing them to tap into Solana's vibrant ecosystem.\\n\\n42.1.1. The Token\\n\\nNEON is a utility token associated with the Neon EVM. The token will be used for governance within the Neon protocol, enabling a decentralized process for proposing and voting for protocol improvements. The Neon EVM economy is based on fees, indicating that NEON might also be used to pay for transactions or services within the Neon ecosystem.\\n\\nAs of this writing, the NEON token has not been officially launched, hence, its specific details, such as the issuance, distribution, and unique features of the NEON token, are not available.\\n\\n42.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Neon protocol could be seen as a digital service or platform that facilitates financial and contractual transactions using smart contracts. As such, it might be characterized as a form of digital service or Mu'amalat (financial transactions) in Islamic jurisprudence. The key consideration would be whether the transactions and contracts executed on the platform conform to Islamic principles, such as the prohibition of Riba (interest), Gharar (excessive uncertainty), and unethical or immoral activities.\\n\\nAs for the NEON token, it could be viewed as a form of digital property (Mal) or a digital asset. Since the token represents a form of value and can be owned and transferred between parties, it could be classified as Mal Mutaqawwam (valid property).\\n\\n42.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBased on the discussion above, Neon protocol and its token can be deemed halal (permissible) in Shariah, as long as they are used in transactions that are in line with Islamic principles (e.g., transactions without Riba, Gharar, or unethical elements).\\n\\n43.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'NEON', 'Official Website': 'https://neonevm.org/; https://neon-labs.org/', 'Official Documentation Link': 'https://neon-labs.org/Neon_EVM.pdf', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neon/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neon', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee', 'Review Date': '23 May 2023'}), Document(page_content=\"Cosmos (ATOM)\\n\\nName of the Protocol\\xa0\\n\\nCosmos\\n\\n43.1.

The Protocol\\n\\nThe Cosmos SDK is an open-source framework for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, like the Cosmos Hub, as well as permissioned Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchains. Blockchains built with the Cosmos SDK are generally referred to as application-specific blockchains.\\n\\nThe Cosmos protocol is a framework for building blockchains that are interoperable with each other. It is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to use. The Cosmos protocol is based on the Tendermint consensus algorithm, which is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm. This means that the Cosmos network can continue to operate even if some of the nodes in the network fail.\\n\\nThe Cosmos protocol has several features that make it well-suited for building interoperable blockchains. These features include:\\n\\nInteroperability:\\xa0The Cosmos protocol allows blockchains to communicate with each other through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. This means that users can transfer tokens and data between different blockchains.\\n\\nScalability:\\xa0The Cosmos protocol is designed to be scalable. This means that it can handle many transactions without becoming congested.\\n\\nSecurity:\\xa0The Cosmos protocol is designed to be secure. This is achieved using the Tendermint consensus algorithm and other security features.\\n\\n43.1.2. The Token\\n\\nThe Cosmos token (ATOM) is the native cryptocurrency of the Cosmos network. It is used to pay for fees on the Cosmos network, to secure the network through staking, and to participate in governance.\\n\\nATOM is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) cryptocurrency. This means that users can earn rewards by staking their ATOM tokens. Staking is the process of locking up ATOM tokens in order to participate in the consensus process.\\n\\nATOM holders can also participate in governance by voting on proposals that affect the Cosmos network. These proposals can include changes to the network's protocol, the distribution of rewards, and other matters.\\n\\n43.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Cosmos protocol is a decentralized platform that allows developers to build blockchains that are interoperable with each other.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBinance Coin (BNB) is an exchange-based token created and issued by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Initially created on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token in July 2017, BNB was migrated over to Binance Chain in February 2019 and became the native coin of the Binance Chain.\\nBNB was designed to be used to pay discounted fees on the Binance platform and function as the native token powering the Binance Chain.\\n\\nBNB can be used as a payment method just like any cryptocurrency, a utility token to pay for fees on the Binance exchange and for participation in token sales on the Binance launchpad. BNB is also used on the Binance DEX (decentralized exchange).\\n\\n1.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nFrom a shariah perspective, BNB is a payment and utility (manfaah) token. It is used for Reduced Trading Fees. When trading fees on Binance are paid using BNB, users are entitled to a certain percentage discount in fees. Sometimes, users with account balances in BNB and certain accumulated trading volume above certain thresholds are given VIP tiers with additional fee discounts and perks. Users can convert non-tradeable amounts of various crypto assets called dust in their Binance account into BNB. Binance’s Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) are conducted using lottery allocations determined using the amount of BNB held by users. Much like how Ether (ETH) is used to pay for fees on the Ethereum Blockchain, BNB is used to pay for fees on the Binance Chain. BNB is needed to trade on the Binance DEX. In addition to being used on Binance’s platforms, BNB can also be used for payments in various ways, such as paying for travels, credit card fees, gifts and other goods and services.\\n\\n1.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBNB is a form of currency and it can be considered as a discount voucher/token as well that gives certain benefits to the users of Binance exchange and DEX as mentioned above. Although, it is used as a payment in the lottery prize on Binance, but that is not a shariah issue, because this activity does not directly impact the subject matter and nature of the token. Therefore, BNB can be considered as a shariah compliant asset.\\n\\n2.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'BNB', 'Name of the Token': 'Binance Coin (BNB)', 'Official Website': 'https://www.binance.com/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/binance-coin', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='USDT\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\n\\nhttps://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TetherWhitePaper.pdf\\n\\n2.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nUSDT is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) that mirrors the price of the U.S. dollar, issued by a Hong Kong-based company Tether. The token’s peg to the USD is achieved via maintaining a sum of dollars in reserves that is equal to the number of USDT in circulation.\\nOriginally launched in July 2014 as Realcoin, a second-layer cryptocurrency token built on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain using the Omni platform, it was later renamed to USTether, and then, finally, to USDT. In addition to Bitcoin’s, USDT was later updated to work on the Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, and OMG blockchains.\\n\\nThe stated purpose of USDT is to combine the unrestricted nature of cryptocurrencies — which can be sent between users without a trusted third-party intermediary — with the stable value of the US dollar.\\n\\n2.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nUSDT is a digital crypto representation of the US dollar. According to the company, Tether, the value of USDT is guaranteed by Tether to remain pegged to the U.S. dollar. Whenever it issues new USDT tokens, it allocates the same amount of USD to its reserves, thus ensuring that USDT is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents. According to the company, the reserves backing the token include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities. \\n\\n2.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe USD is considered a shariah compliant asset, based on the shariah rulings regarding the validity of the transactions being done in USD, and the ruling of paying zakat on USD reserves. USDT is pegged against the value of the USD. However, there is a shariah concern regarding the cash equivalents backing the value of USDT. These cash equivalents may involve riba-based loans, and financial products like bonds. However, those reserves only used to maintain the peg of USDT with the value of USD. The reserves are not directly attached with USDT in the sense that the holder of USDT has a direct ownership of the underlying reserves. Therefore, USDT can be considered as shariah compliant.\\n\\n3.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Tether (USDT)', 'Official Website': 'https://tether.to/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content=\"LINK\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\n\\nhttps://link.smartcontract.com/whitepaper\\n\\n3.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nChainlink is a decentralized oracle network that brings off-chain data into an on-chain format, bridging the gap between the isolated blockchain and real-world data. Since blockchains cannot access data outside their network, oracles (a defi instrument) are needed to function as data feeds in smart contracts. In Chainlink's case, the oracles are connected to the Ethereum network. Oracles provide external data (e.g., temperature, weather) that trigger smart contract executions upon the fulfilment of predefined conditions. It also aims to ensure that the external information (pricing, weather data, event outcomes) fed to smart contracts remains untampered with. Chainlink is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and Chainlink (LINK) is the native token of the protocol. LINK is used to pay Chainlink network operators for their services. LINK has two use-cases: \\n\\nInternal Payment: This is the currency used to pay the Chainlink node operators for their work.\\n\\nStaking: Chainlink node operators must stake in the network in order to participate and provide data services. Nodes with higher stakes have a higher chance of getting selected to provide the requested data.\\n\\nSome of the data providers are: Binance, CoinGecko, Houbi, CryptoCompare, Everipedia, Brave NewCoin, Amber Data, Kaiko, etc. Some of the notable players participating in the Chainlink ecosystem include Aave, Synthetix, Yearn.Finance, and Google.\\n\\nLINK is an ERC20 token, with the additional ERC223 'transfer and call' functionality of transfer, allowing tokens to be received and processed by contracts within a single transaction. Following the 2017 $32 million LINK ICO, 32 percent of LINK tokens were sent to node operators to incentivize the ecosystem and 30 percent stayed within Chainlink for development (35 percent were sold in the public token sale).\\n\\n3.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nChainlink is a protocol that transforms real world (off-chain data) into on-chain data through oracles. It provides data in the form of data feeds in smart contracts. In this sense, it can be considered as data providing service from a shariah perspective. The LINK token is used in 2 ways:\\n\\nAs a payment token: data providers can sell their existing data and API services and get paid in the form of LINK. Node operators also get paid in the form of LINK for running and maintaining oracle infrastructure that ensures smart contracts across every blockchain have secure access to the highest quality real-world data.\\n\\nStaking: Since the Chainlink network has a reputation system, node providers that have a large amount of LINK can be rewarded with larger contracts, while a failure to deliver accurate information results in a deduction of tokens. In this way, staking is used to act as a carrot and stick mechanism.\\n\\n3.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nLooking at the data providers, it seems that most of the data is relevant to blockchain-based transactions and other information related to blockchain-based projects. In this sense, the data can be considered as a shariah compliant subject matter. The protocol provides easy and decentralized access to that data as a service, while ensuring its authenticity, so it can be considered as a shariah compliant service.\\n\\nThe issuance of LINK and its usage as a payment and staking token also does not seem to be involved in any shariah prohibition. Hence, it is shariah compliant.\\n\\n4.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Chainlink (LINK)', 'Official Website': 'https://chain.link/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chainlink', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='UNISWAP\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\n\\nhttps://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf\\n\\n4.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nUniswap is a decentralized protocol for creating liquidity and trading ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. It aims at decentralization, censorship resistance, and security. It eliminates intermediaries and unnecessary forms of rent extraction, allowing for fast and efficient trading.\\n\\nUsers just need an Ethereum wallet like Metamask and they can immediately start swapping tokens. Users can then swap tokens directly without the need of an orderbook. This works using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) where Liquidity Providers (LP) deposit tokens into the smart contract and this liquidity then provides a price quote to traders without relying on any professional market makers. Liquidity Providers are compensated with a 0.3% trading fee for providing liquidity on the protocol.\\n\\nUNI is the governance token for Uniswap. UNI was introduced on 16th September 2020 through a retrospective airdrop to users who have interacted with the protocol either by swapping tokens or by providing liquidity.\\n\\nUNI as a governance token aims at community-led growth, development, and self-sustainability. UNI is focused on a shared community ownership and governance system, to guide the protocol in the future. UNI officially makes Uniswap as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to keep autonomous qualities.\\n\\n4.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIt is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that makes it easy for users to swap an ERC-20 token for another ERC-20 token without the need of a centralized intermediary. With a DEX, traders do not have to deposit their tokens on an exchange and be exposed to the security risks of a centralized exchange.\\n\\nUNI token was first air dropped (free distribution) and its mining was started at the same time through liquidity pools. It allows token holders to participate in the governance of the protocol. Key decisions such as Uniswap governance, UNI community treasury, the protocol fee switch, uniswap.eth ENS name, Uniswap Default List (tokens.uniswap.eth) and SOCKS liquidity tokens are being done through UNI token.\\n\\n4.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token: \\n\\nThe protocol/platform has mixed (shariah compliant and non-shariah compliant) crypto assets because there is no limit of trading pairs at the UniSwap. People can create markets for any pair they like for trading purposes. So, it is possible that a trading pair may consist of non-shariah compliant crypto assets. However, the platform/protocol can be considered as a neutral subject matter or product because it is not biased towards non-shariah compliant assets. \\n\\nUNI token as a governance mechanism for the protocol may not have any direct shariah prohibition. Therefore, it is shariah compliant.\\n\\n5.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'UNI', 'Official Website': 'https://uniswap.org/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='USDC\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\n\\nhttps://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/9304636/PDF/centre-whitepaper.pdf\\n\\n5.1.

Every unit of this cryptocurrency in circulation is backed up by $1 that is held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds.\\n\\n5.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIt is like USDT, but the difference between USDT and USDC is that USDC is externally audited and more aligned with the regulatory and compliance framework. In terms of the issuance, usage, underlying backing, there is not much difference between the two.\\n\\n5.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe USD is considered a shariah compliant asset, based on the shariah rulings regarding the validity of the transactions being done in USD, and the ruling of paying zakat on USD reserves.

Main Function of the Protocol:\\n\\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is an ERC-20 digital asset backed by Bitcoin (BTC) in a 1:1 fashion. When a user wishes to exchange BTC for WBTC, he/she will be required to send his/her BTC to a Merchant. The Merchant will initiate a WBTC mint request and send the BTC from the user to the Custodian. The Custodian will then mint the corresponding WBTC, which will be subsequently transferred to the user via the Merchant. When a user wishes to redeem his/her BTC with WBTC, the Merchant would communicate with the Custodian and transfer the user's BTC back to him/her, while the WBTC token will be burnt.\\n\\n6.2. Description of the Protocol from Shariah Point of View: \\n\\nA wrapped token is a cryptocurrency token pegged to the value of another crypto. It’s called a wrapped token because the original asset is put in a wrapper, a kind of digital vault that allows the wrapped version to be created on another blockchain. A wrapped token is like a stablecoin in that it derives its value from another asset. In a stablecoin's case, that’s usually fiat currency. In a wrapped token’s case, it’s usually an asset natively living on another blockchain.\\n\\nThere are a few key players in the WBTC ecosystem. They are: \\n\\nCustodian - Custodians are institutions that store crypto assets. In the case of WBTC, BitGo is responsible for custodying Bitcoin.\\n\\nMerchant - Merchants play a key role in the distribution of WTBC by minting or burning WBTC.\\n\\nUsers - Users are holders of WBTC. Users can use WBTC to transfer and transact like any other ERC20 token in the Ethereum ecosystem.\\n\\nWBTC DAO Member - WBTC DAO is the governing body that is responsible for contract changes and the addition/removal of custodian and merchant. This governance body helps decentralize the network via multi-sig contracts which requires all members to reach consensus before initiating a change.\\n\\nIn another word, wrap tokens work in a similar way to the Islamic contract of Wadi’ah. The token represents ownership of the underlying deposits. When these tokens exchange hands, it is the ownership of the underlying crypto that gets transferred to the new holder, through constructive possession.\\n\\n6.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol:\\n\\nIt is permissible to trade WBTC. Since the token represents BTC as a currency, all the rulings pertaining to currencies will apply when trading WBTC.\\n\\n7.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)', 'Official Website': 'https://wbtc.network/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Cronos (CRO)\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://whitepaper.cronos.org/\\n\\n7.1. Main Function of the Protocol:\\n\\nCRO Tokens are the utility token for the Crypto.com ecosystem. The Crypto.com Chain was created to build a network of cryptocurrency projects and develop merchants’ ability to accept crypto as a form of payment. An overview of the products offered by Crypto.com is as followed:\\n\\nPayment - Crypto.com Pay, Visa Card\\n\\nTrading - Crypto.com App, Crypto.com Exchange\\n\\nFinancial Services - Decentralized Finance Products, Crypto Earn, Crypto Credit\\n\\n7.2. Description of the Protocol from Shariah Point of View:\\n\\nCrypto.com is essentially functioning like a bank. Some of their services such as payments to merchants can be considered as halal whilst others such as lending are most likely not permissible if it involves the receipt of interest. The CRO token will power all the products offered on their blockchain. CRO acts as an intermediary currency, allowing you to convert your cryptocurrencies into fiat counterparts at a much-reduced cost. All users on the chain will need to fund block transaction fees using CRO, and tokens can be earned as rewards for processing and verifying transactions on the network. CRO token should therefore be seen primarily as payment token although it may provide certain benefits like utility tokens.\\n\\n7.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol:\\n\\nAlthough the ecosystem may have certain haram elements, it can also be used for halal purposes. Since the CRO tokens are also considered to be like a cryptocurrency, it is permissible to trade and hold CRO tokens like any other currencies.\\n\\n8.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Cronos (CRO)', 'Official Website': 'https://crypto.com/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cronos/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cronos', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='OKB (OKB)\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://www.okx.com/okb\\n\\n8.1.

OKB has developed 52 application scenarios internally and externally, covering payments, market data, wallet, lending and wealth management, cybersecurity, travel, lifestyle, and entertainment applications, which allow holders to purchase products or services with OKB.\\n\\n8.2. Description of the Protocol from Shariah Point of View:\\n\\nOKEx platform has a wide range of services that are mostly non shariah compliant, such as interest-based lending, trading of derivatives etc. On the other hand, it also offers an exchange based on spot trading which should be acceptable from a shariah perspective. As for the OKB tokens, it can also be traded within an ecosystem which is external to OKEx, such as means of payments for shariah compliant purposes (e.g., aviation and security services or to purchase items such as bags and fashion accessories from certain retailers). It is therefore a currency rather than a utility token.\\n\\n8.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol:\\n\\nThe internal ecosystem has shariah and non shariah compliant services, and the token itself can also be used externally for compliant and non-compliant services too. Therefore, it is fair to say that the token itself as a cryptocurrency is shariah compliant. \\n\\n9.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'OKB (OKB)', 'Official Website': 'https://www.okx.com/okb', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/okb/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/okb', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Huobi Token (HT)\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\n9.1.

(iFinex), is a company that operates a cryptocurrency trading platform, under the name Bitfinex, and provides numerous other crypto asset related products and services.\\n\\nLEO was launched in May 2019, on 2 different blockchains, Ethereum and EOS. It is a utility token for use across the iFinex ecosystem and other iFinex trading platforms, particularly on Bitfinex. It allows Bitfinex users to save money on trading fees. The extent of the discount depends on how much LEO that a customer has in his/her account. Different discount offers are spread across three tiers. There are fluctuations in the discount offers depending on whether a trading pair is crypto-to-crypto, or crypto-to stablecoin.\\n\\nUnlike many other cryptocurrencies out there, it is not designed to exist forever. iFinex is committed to buying back LEO from the market monthly. The amount that is purchased and burned is equal to at least 27% of the revenues generated by iFinex — and tokens are also purchased at the market rate. Currently (13 March 2021) 4.155% LEO tokens have been burnt.\\n\\nLEO’s utility lies in reductions of fees and other discounts on BitFinex and other products, as well as similar fee reductions and/or other features and benefits for future iFinex trading platforms, products, and services.\\n\\n12.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nFrom the shariah perspective, LEO is a utility (manfaah) token. It is used for Reduced Trading Fees, so it is a discount voucher. When trading fees on Bitfinex are paid using LEO, users are entitled to a certain percentage discount in fees.\\n\\n12.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nLEO can be considered as a discount voucher/token that gives certain benefits to the users of Bitfinex exchange and other iFinex products as mentioned above. Although, it also gives a discount in the fees for transactions that involve derivatives, interest-based lending, but that is not a shariah issue in the nature of LEO as a subject matter, because these activities do not directly impact the nature of the token.

As the number of miners in ZILLIQA increases, its transaction rates are expected to increase. It is claimed that ZILLIQA would expect to process about a thousand times the\\n\\ntransaction rates of Ethereum. The cornerstone in ZILLIQA’s design is the idea of sharding, dividing the mining network into smaller shards each capable of processing transactions in parallel. The platform hosts many decentralized applications, and it also allows for staking and yield farming.\\n\\nThe native asset of Zilliqa, ZIL, is used to process transactions on the network and execute smart contracts. Although it is claimed to be a utility token, it seems that it is a cryptocurrency, meaning that it is mainly used for payment on the network to smart contracts and miners. It has a finite supply of 21 billion ZILs. \\n\\n13.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nFrom the shariah perspective, ZIL is designed to be a currency or payment token.

Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nNo shariah prohibition is found in the issuance (40% pre-mined and 60% mining). There is no shariah issue if the tokens are pre-mined, and if they are mined, even then the mining process does not involve any shariah non-compliant element, therefore, it is fine.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nFANTOM is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based blockchain platform that intends to solve the scalability issues of existing blockchain platforms. One of the arguments is that DAG is not a blockchain, but a different distributed ledger technology that can run smart contracts.\\n\\nFANTOM is different from the traditional blockchain-based storage infrastructure by attempting to employ an improved version of existing DAG-based protocols. It uses a different protocol known as the “Lachesis Protocol'' to maintain consensus. This protocol is intended to be integrated into the Fantom OPERA Chain. The aim is to allow applications built on top of the FANTOM OPERA Chain to enjoy instant transactions and near zero transaction costs for all users.\\n\\nThe main objective of FANTOM is to provide compatibility between all transaction bodies around the world and create an ecosystem which allows real-time transactions and data sharing with low cost.\\n\\nThis platform has its own native token called FTM with an in-built compatibility with ERC20 standards. Another version of FTM is available on Binance Chain using its BEP20 standard. Only the native FTM can be used on the Fantom OPERA mainnet itself. The token forms the backbone of transactions on the platform, and allows fee collection and staking activities, along with the user rewards the latter represents. Staking forms an important part of tokenomics of FTM, with a proportion of the supply reserved specifically for staking rewards to users who hold FTM.\\n\\n14.2.

Main Function of the Protocol:\\n\\nBUSD is a stablecoin founded by Paxos and Binance. Paxos uses blockchain technology to offer their Stablecoin as a Service product to external companies. BUSD is a fiat-backed stablecoin that maintains a U.S. dollar peg. An amount of U.S. dollars equal to the total supply of BUSD is held in custody by Paxos, acting as its reserves in FDIC-insured U.S. banks or backed by U.S. Treasuries. When the price of the U.S. dollar rises or falls, the price of BUSD also does in equal amounts. This is the most common and traditional model of stablecoin.\\n\\n16.2. Description of the Protocol from Shariah Point of View:\\n\\nFrom a shariah perspective many stablecoins function just as same as currencies which could be halal in itself. BUSD is a regulated, fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. For every unit of BUSD, there is one U.S. dollar held in reserve. In other words, the supply of BUSD is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a 1:1 ratio. Holders can swap their tokens for fiat and vice versa. Paxos, the token’s issuer, releases monthly attestations of BUSD’s reserves.\\n\\nAs a stablecoin, BUSD is designed to maintain a stable market value. It allows investors and traders to hold a low-volatility asset on the blockchain without the need to exit the crypto space.\\n\\n16.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol: \\n\\nThe USD is considered a shariah compliant asset, based on the shariah rulings regarding the validity of the transactions being done in USD, and the ruling of paying zakat on USD reserves. BUSD is pegged against the value of the USD. However, there is a shariah concern regarding the cash equivalents backing the value of BUSD. These cash equivalents may involve riba-based loans, and financial products like bonds. However, those reserves are only used to maintain the peg of BUSD with the value of USD. The reserves are not directly attached with BUSD in the sense that the holder of BUSD has a direct ownership of the underlying reserves. Therefore, BUSD can be considered as shariah compliant.\\n\\n17.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'BUSD', 'Official Website': 'https://www.binance.com/en/busd', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/binance-usd', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content=\"VeChain (VET)\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://www.vechain.org/whitepaper/#bit_65sv8\\n\\n17.1. Main Function of the Protocol:\\n\\nVeChain is a blockchain built to help make supply chain management simpler. It was originally conceived to determine if a real-life product is fake or not - preventing frauds and knockoffs. Since then, it’s been used by major corporations to help track everything from wine production to car manufacturing.\\n\\nThe way it does that is simple: give each product a unique identity, then use sensors to track what happens at each stage of the supply chain. That way, companies can be sure products are handled correctly, and consumers can verify their purchases are legitimate. \\n\\nVeChain has two separate tokens: VET and VTHO:\\n\\nVET (VeChain Token) is used for financial transactions on the VeChainThor blockchain and market speculation.\\n\\nVTHO (VeThor Token) is the “energy token” that’s used to conduct transactions on VeChainThor. The VeThor (VTHO) token is referred to as the “energy token”, used as gas to pay for transactions on the network. Each time any data is added to the blockchain through any financial or data transaction, this will require units of computational power. The VTHO token is used to cover the computational gas costs for all transactions on the VeChainThor blockchain. The cost will vary depending on the data and size of the transaction being processed.\\n\\n17.2. Description of the Protocol from Shariah Point of View:\\n\\nVET is the payment used in VeChain's system. The more VET a person or enterprise holds, the higher priority when it comes to using the blockchain's resources. From a shariah perspective, this indicates that VET is a hybrid token that acts as a means of payment and provides benefits to its holder.\\n\\n17.3.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBasic Attention Token, or BAT, is the token that is used on a blockchain-based digital advertising platform designed to reward users for their attention, while providing advertisers with a return on their ad spend.\\n\\nThis experience is delivered through the Brave Browser, where users can watch privacy-preserving adverts and receive BAT rewards for doing so. On the other hand, advertisers can deliver targeted ads to maximize engagement and cut down losses due to ad fraud and abuse.\\n\\nThe Basic Attention Token itself is the unit of reward in this advertising ecosystem, and is exchanged between advertisers, publishers, and users. Advertisers pay for their advertising campaigns in BAT tokens. Out of this budget, a small portion is distributed to publishers, while 70% is distributed to users — whereas the intermediaries that typically drive-up advertising costs are cut out of the equation to improve cost-efficiency.\\n\\nBrave browser’s value proposition is its privacy-centric advertisements which do not track users, and that they are only opt-in. As users browse the web and opt into advertisements on Brave, they are rewarded with BAT for their attention. Publishers also receive a share of the BAT if they can retain quality users, while advertisers get better returns on their advertising funds by being able to reach quality audiences who are willing to pay attention to ads.\\n\\nUsers who have BAT can also choose to automatically contribute their BAT tokens to publishers based on their attention spent on the website or to manually tip them. Some known publishers who have signed up with Brave include The Washington Post, Vice, The Guardian, and more.\\n\\n18.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBAT is a native token on Brave Browser, and it is categorized as a utility token with ERC20 standards on Ethereum blockchain. It is not mineable, as all the tokens have been minted at the time of its ICO.\\n\\nUsers can either buy BAT at different exchanges where BAT is listed, or they can earn BAT by viewing ads served by the Brave browser, acquiring random BAT rewards, or joining the Brave Rewards Creators program. Users can choose to stream BAT tokens to publishers automatically or to tip their favourite publisher that they wish to support through Brave Rewards. BAT can also be collateralized on Maker to mint a new supply of DAI.\\n\\nFrom the shariah perspective, it is a utility and reward token with a focus on digital advertising. It is also used as a payment system within the Brave Browser platform contributors (the community).\\n\\n18.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nAlthough digital advertising is considered as a mixed activity from the shariah perspective, the consideration should be given to the main issuance, structure, and nature of the token itself. Moreover, as a payment system it can be considered neutral with respect to the digital advertisement. Therefore, it can be considered as a shariah compliant token.\\n\\n19.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Basic Attention Token (BAT)', 'Official Website': 'https://basicattentiontoken.org/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/basic-attention-token', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content=\"REN\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\n\\nhttps://renproject.io/litepaper.pdf\\n\\n19.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nRen is an ecosystem for building, deploying, and running general purpose, privacy preserving and multiparty computation protocol. It makes it possible for any kind of application to run in a decentralized, trust-less, and fault tolerant environment similar to blockchains but with the distinguishing feature that all application inputs, outputs, and state, remain a secret even to the participants running the network. Although Ren can power any kind of application, finance is the main use case for it. As such, Ren initially focuses on the state of private decentralized finance, and to provide a standard economic layer for future applications. There are three core components of REN such as:\\n\\nA zero-knowledge transaction layer will make it possible to store and transfer tokens without exposing wallet balances or transaction amounts.\\n\\nAn interoperability layer will extend zero-knowledge transactions and make it possible to execute trust-less swaps between blockchains, and to bridge tokens from one blockchain to another.\\n\\nA dark pool layer will provide secret order matching engines that work with orders known only to their owner. This will allow users to open orders without exposing the price or volume of their order to anyone, including the exchange itself. Using zero-knowledge transactions, users can then settle order matches in secret.\\n\\nIt was formerly known as Republic Protocol and originally wanted to be a “dark pool'' decentralized exchange project. A “dark pool” is an exchange in which financial assets are first matched and then traded on an order book that is private.\\n\\nREN tokens were originally used to pay for transactional fees and used as a bond by those running the Dark nodes. The protocol rebranded itself in 2019 and focused on being a DeFi interoperability solution. Ever since then, REN is mainly used as a bond to operate the Dark nodes. Dark nodes function similarly to a validator node on a proof of stake blockchain.\\n\\nRen Protocol is a permissionless and trust-less protocol that allows users to transfer tokens across different blockchains. Ren’s core product, RenVM is focused on building an interoperability solution for Decentralized Finance (DeFi). RenVM offers liquidity to the Ethereum network and DeFi sector, through a value exchange bridge for users to convert their BTC, BCH and ZEC into an ERC-20 token equivalent. This ERC-20 token representing bitcoin is known as renBTC and can then be used on a wide selection of DeFi applications on Ethereum which includes features like lending, borrowing, trading and more.\\n\\nThe protocol’s native token, REN, functions as a bond for those running nodes which power RenVM, known as Darknodes. Ren charges various fees for internal operations, but most do not go towards direct profitability, instead being paid to miners. As an ERC-20 token, REN also attracts varying gas fees to power transactions.\\n\\nTo qualify and operate as a Darknode, one needs to stake 100,000 REN as collateral. Darknode entities earn a portion of the transaction fees collected during the swap. The fees are paid in the form of cryptocurrency that is being traded. For example, it will cost users a fee to swap bitcoin to renBTC and the Darknode facilitator will be entitled to a portion of the fees. The fees involved in the transaction are paid in the form of bitcoin.\\n\\n19.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe REN protocol converts non-ERC20 assets (BTC, BCH and ZEC) into ERC20 tokens (renBTC, renBCH, and reZEC respectively). For this conversion, it charges a fee in the form of the same crypto asset that is converted.\\n\\nREN token is used to register and run a Darknode. For every Darknode that a user registers, he will need to acquire 100,000 REN and be prepared to bond them into an Ethereum smart contract. This bond is returned after the Darknode is deregistered. In this way, it is like a security deposit.\\n\\nSo, first a user will need to buy 100,000 REN to deposit it as a security to run a Darknode, which will in turn, earn him BTC, BCH or ZEC as profit. Once he stops running the Darknode, his 100,000 REN will be given back to him.\\n\\n19.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nSince the underlying asset (BTC) is shariah compliant, its equivalent token renBTC would also be shariah compliant in nature. REN token is only used as a security deposit on the network, so it also seems to be shariah compliant.\\n\\n20.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'REN (REN)', 'Official Website': 'https://renproject.io/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ren/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ren', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='ETH\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\n\\nhttps://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/\\n\\n20.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nEthereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. In other words, Ethereum tries to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner, while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible. Ethereum supports smart contracts in which developers can write code to program digital value. Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum include token, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.\\n\\nIn addition to smart contracts, Ethereum can host other crypto assets, called “tokens,” through the use of its ERC-20 compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far: to date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched. Over 40 of these make the top-100 crypto assets by market capitalization, for example, USDT, LINK and BNB.\\n\\nWhile Ethereum refers to the blockchain network. The native currency that flows within the Ethereum economy is called Ether (ETH). Ether is typically used to pay for transaction fees called Gas, and it is the base currency of the network.\\n\\nOn Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation. Gas fees are paid entirely in ETH. \\n\\n20.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nEthereum is a decentralized open source blockchain system. It works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts. In this way, it is a shariah neutral platform which can be used for mixed purposes.\\n\\nThe native cryptocurrency of the platform, ETH, also seems to be shariah neutral.\\n\\nETH protocol and the currency have been certified as shariah compliant by Amanie Advisors. The link to their shariah paper is as: https://amanieadvisors.com/download/1459/\\n\\n20.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBased on the critical analysis of the objectives, structure, and nature, no shariah issues are fundamentally present in the protocol and token. Therefore, it seems that ETH is shariah compliant.\\n\\n21.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Ethereum (ETH)', 'Official Website': 'https://ethereum.org/en/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Bitcoin\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\n\\nhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\\n\\n21.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized digital currency that is based on cryptography. As such, it can operate without the need of a central authority like a central bank or a company. It is unlike government-issued or fiat currencies such as US Dollars or Euro in which they are controlled by the country’s central bank. The decentralized nature allows it to operate on a peer-to-peer network whereby users can send funds to each other without going through intermediaries. It appears that the market values bitcoin for the following reasons.\\n\\nDigital Gold - It is a viable digital store of value due to its digital scarcity.\\n\\nPayment - Almost instant and low-cost transaction with anyone on the internet\\n\\nSpeculation - There are people speculating that Bitcoin may be the asset class of the future.\\n\\n21.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use. Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market.\\n\\nBitcoin plays the functions of money or currencies in general, although not issued by a government authority. Based on its wide acceptance and usage in practice, Bitcoin seems to fulfil the criteria of mal, money and thamaniyyah (monetary usage). Bitcoin does not contain any explicitly shariah-prohibited elements in it.  Thus, adhering to the legal maxim “original rule in Shariah is that of permissibility in financial transactions”, Bitcoin can be accepted from a Shariah perspective.\\n\\n21.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBitcoin has legal value because in practice it is exchanged for other currencies, goods and services. It is permissible to exchange Bitcoin for other currencies, as well as accept them as a counter value in commodity transactions, furthermore it could be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies that are considered permissible. Exchanging Bitcoin with other currencies or with gold and silver are all governed by the money/currency exchange rules (bai al sarf) of Shariah.\\n\\n22.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Bitcoin (BTC)', 'Official Website': 'https://bitcoin.org/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Tezos\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\n\\nhttps://tezos.com/whitepaper.pdf\\n\\n22.1. Main Function of the Protocol: \\n\\nTezos operates like many of its blockchain competitors, as a platform for creating and running decentralized applications (DApps), as well as exchanging assets.  People who hold XTZ can vote on proposals for protocol upgrades that have been put forward by Tezos developers. Tezos operates like many of its blockchain competitors, as a platform for creating and running decentralized applications (DApps), as well as exchanging assets. Smart contracts on Tezos are written in the Michelson programming language, designed specifically for the protocol. To perform transactions on the network, you use gas, which is converted into fees in the Tezos cryptocurrency, XTZ.\\n\\nTezos is a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain. Technically, it uses a variant of PoS called Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), although the implementation is unique to Tezos. \\n\\nParticipants who hold over 8,000 Tezos can become delegates and run the network through baking and endorsing. Baking means creating new blocks (essentially another word for staking), while endorsing means “agreeing” on a block created by a baker. Alternatively, if a token holder doesn’t have 8,000 XTZ or doesn’t want to set up the required hardware themselves, they can delegate these tasks to someone else.\\n\\n22.2. Description of the Protocol from Shariah Point of View: \\n\\nTezos is a platform that provides generic compliant services. Its native token is a hybrid token that can be used as a means of payment and gives voting rights to its holder.\\n\\n22.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol: \\n\\nThe generic nature of the platform can be used for halal/purposes, and the fact that the native token has halal usage, confirm that it Tezos is shariah compliant.\\n\\n23.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'XTZ', 'Official Website': 'https://tezos.com/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tezos/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tezos', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Shiba Inu\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://github.com/shytoshikusama/woofwoofpaper/raw/main/SHIBA_INU_WOOF_WOOF.pdf\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n23.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nIt is a fun cryptocurrency or meme token that aims to transform itself into a decentralized system. The protocol claims to be a completely decentralized and community driven platform. The Shib token is an ERC20 token which might be used at the ShibSwap - a decentralized exchange - and an incubator - an NFT marketplace? In this sense, it might have some utility, but at the moment, it is not defined yet and the platform and the token do not have anything to offer.\\xa0\\n\\n23.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nShib does not seem to have an actual utility, at least at the moment. It was launched as a mockery or competitor of Doge coin, another meme token. According to the official website, the Shiba Inu token is “the foundational currency that allows investors to hold millions, billions, or even trillions, of it in their wallets”. While the platform boasts about being decentralized and community driven only, without an objective.\\xa0\\n\\nThe initial supply of the Shib token was 1 quadrillion. Ryoshi - the founder of the token - locked 50% of the supply in Uniswap, then transferred the other half to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for safekeeping. He did not hold any token for him/herself. Vitalik gave 10% of his Shib holding to a charity - India’s COVID-19 Relief Fund and burned 40% of its total supply to a dead wallet. That is the only real use case of this token so far.\\xa0\\n\\nIt clearly shows that it does not have a real economic objective. It only got famous due to Vitalik’s charity giving and burning the rest of his allocation. Mostly it has been used for speculation only. Elon Musk’s tweets also fueled the speculative activity with this token.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n23.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nIt is clear that this token has no well-defined purpose, utility or any other benefit on which a shariah ruling can be based. It is purely a speculative token, which people bet on for unusual price action. In this sense, its usage is questionable, and its harm is greater than its benefits. Moreover, the whole branding of the platform and token is related to a dog-breed which might be a shariah issue as well.\\xa0\\n\\nIt might not have a shariah issue at micro - issuance, default nature - or technological - blockchain, crypto token - level. But it surely has usage and brand perception issues that can lead to other macro issues. Considering the Islamic legal maxims of avoiding the means to impermissible things and harm to the users, it does not seem to be shariah compliant.\\xa0\\n\\n24.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Shiba Inu (SHIB)', 'Official Website': 'https://shibatoken.com/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='MANA (Decentraland)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://decentraland.org/whitepaper.pdf\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n24.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nDecentraland is a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain which provides an infrastructure to support a shared virtual world, also known as a metaverse. It consists of a decentralized ledger for virtual land ownership, a protocol for describing the content of each land parcel, and a peer-to-peer network for user interactions. Through this platform, users can create, experience, and monetize content and applications.\\xa0\\n\\nThe concept of land in Decentraland refers to a parcel of land in the 3D virtual world. Users can permanently own any land they purchase. They can create from any static 3D scenes to interactive systems such as games on their land. Landowners control what content is published to their portion of land. Individual parcels of land can be combined into estates to form larger plots of land.\\xa0\\n\\nDecentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an ERC-20 token that is used as a medium of exchange on the platform. MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a range of avatars, wearables, names, goods, services, and more on the Decentraland marketplace.\\xa0\\n\\n24.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nDecentraland can be considered a virtual asset from the Shariah point of view because it is a “space” in a digital world, that can be specified, owned, distinguished, transferred from one party to another party. Its utility is based on its adjacency to other famous/important hubs (strategic location), its ability to host applications, and its identity mechanism.\\xa0\\n\\nMANA is purely a payment token that is used as a medium of exchange. It derives its value from the overall system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n24.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThere seems to be no problem with the conceptual foundation of the project, and its native payment token, MANA. It is a free world where users can build anything they want, the applications can be halal or haram, it highly depends on the users. However, currently the land in this metaverse is mostly used for games, arts, and places with bars and discos, which may raise some shariah concerns.\\n\\nSince most of the applications are either haram or in gray area, the platform may be seen to lead to haram things. Hence, to stop the means to haram things, it should be avoided.

It is like an ownership certificate of a piece of land in the metaverse. Users may purchase LAND directly from the official Marketplace of Decentraland, or they can buy LAND from the secondary markets, such as OpenSea.\\xa0\\n\\n25.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nLAND is simply a cryptographic representation of a “piece of land” in Decentraland. In this sense, it is shariah neutral, because the parcel of land in Decentraland is an empty “space”. It highly depends on the users what they build on their piece of land.\\xa0\\n\\n25.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nCurrently, the land in this metaverse is mostly used for games, arts, and places with bars and discos, which may raise some shariah concerns, because the same is reflected by LAND token. \\n\\nSince most of the applications are either haram or in gray area, the platform may be seen to lead to haram things.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nAxie Infinity is a blockchain-based video game that is partially owned and operated by its players. Inspired by popular games like Pokémon and Tamagotchi, Axie Infinity is a trading and battling video game. It allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based digital creatures known as Axies. Each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT) with different attributes.\\xa0\\n\\nThe Axie Infinity ecosystem also has its own unique governance token, known as Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). AXS are an ERC 20 governance token for the Axie universe. AXS has three main functions:\\xa0\\n\\nStaking: Players can lock up their tokens to receive newly created AXS. Stakers are also required to vote and play to claim rewards.\\xa0\\n\\nPayment: AXS is accepted as currency within the Axie NFT marketplace. AXS may also be used to determine eligibility for participation in certain sales/auctions conducted by the Axie team.\\xa0\\n\\nGovernance: AXS are used to participate in key governance votes and will give holders a say in how funds in the Axie Community Treasury are spent.\\xa0\\n\\nThe platform has another token called Smooth Love Potions, $SLP.\\xa0\\n\\n26.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nAxie Infinity is a video game platform. The theme of the game is to create unique creatures and win battles with them. The main objective of this game is purely fun and entertainment, without any other outcome.\\xa0\\n\\nAXS is simply a governance token that gives its holder the right to vote in the system. It can also be used as a medium of exchange at the platform.\\xa0\\n\\n26.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThis platform is based on a video game. Its two tokens also derived their value from the main platform. The theme of the video game itself does not seem to be haram, as it has a specific theme - creating unique creatures and doing battles with them. However the graphics and appearance of the creatures is objectionable according to the mainstream view. Such video games are considered a gray area in the mainstream shariah opinions. Moreover, there are a few shariah concerns, for example in-game music, betting (gambling), and involvement of people in an unproductive activity. It may lead to haram things as well.

This digital asset serves a replacement for experience points.\\xa0\\n\\nSLP are tokens that can be used to breed new digital pets, known as Axies. It was formerly known as Small Love Potion before the token upgrade to the Ronin blockchain.\\xa0\\n\\nIn other words, SLP is used for the purpose of breeding different creatures and can be earned by winning battles and adventures in the game. It is not a governance token, therefore it is not used for voting.\\xa0\\n\\nYou can buy Axies to play the game. Another way of obtaining Axies would be through some interest groups that offer Axies as a loan in the form of a scholarship. SLP earned from the game are splitted between the scholarship holders and the group lending out the Axies.\\xa0\\n\\nSLP earnings can vary depending on the players' skill and their energy resources. With the latest update, players can only earn SLP by competing in arena mode by battling other players. P2E mode will no longer reward players with a new supply of tokens.\\xa0\\n\\n27.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nSLP is simply a token that can be earned through playing specific modes or levels of the game, Axie Infinity. A sufficient amount of these tokens can be used to create other creatures. In this sense, it has a limited scope. It can be considered as a proof-of-play token.\\xa0\\n\\nAlthough, SLP’s nature and mechanics does not directly violate shariah principles, video games are considered to be shariah non-compliant or gray at the best.

FTX claims that it stands out due to such features as clawback prevention, a centralized collateral pool and universal stablecoin settlement.\\xa0\\n\\nFTT is the native crypto token of the crypto derivatives trading platform FTX. The FTT token provides certain incentives such as trading fee rebates for its holders, with the % discount increasing along with the amount of FTT held.\\xa0\\n\\nTo increase the value of FTT, FTX has designed some utility and network effects for it. For example, FTT can be used as collateral for futures positions. Customers who hold a certain amount of FTT for a period of time will receive lower FTX futures fees. Customers who hold enough FTT will receive rebates from all of their OTC trading on FTX.\\xa0\\n\\nFTX also has a burning mechanism to reduce the supply of FTT and hence increase its value. For example, there will be a repurchase and burning of FTT based on OTC volumes and revenue from the FTX OTC portal.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThe Sandbox is a blockchain-based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community.\\xa0\\n\\nAccording to the official whitepaper, the Sandbox platform’s main mission is to successfully introduce blockchain technology in mainstream gaming. The platform focuses on facilitating a creative “play-to-earn” model, which allows users to be both creators and gamers simultaneously. The Sandbox employs the powers of blockchain technology by introducing the SAND utility token, which facilitates transactions on the platform.\\xa0\\n\\nSAND is the utility token of the Sandbox’s versatile ecosystem and can be used for creating ASSET tokens, buying and selling ASSETS on the marketplace, participating in transactions involving LAND, and to interact with user-generated experiences.\\xa0\\n\\nSAND is also the governance token of the Sandbox DAO, which means that ownership of SAND tokens grants users voting rights to improve the platform as they wish.\\xa0\\n\\n29.2.

Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nTwo issues can be raised regarding Sandbox, one is should Muslims be encouraged in spending time in gaming? One may argue that Sandbox is not a game in a true sense as it is being monetized and therefore should be seen as an investment.

Players can own non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and influence the governance of games within the Gala Games ecosystem. The Founder’s Nodes voting mechanism allows players to influence what games Gala should develop and what games should get funding.\\xa0\\n\\nUsers can run Gala Nodes, which supports the Gala network. In return, they receive rewards like GALA, limited edition NFTs and other opportunities. The Gala Node ecosystem consists of a triple-proof node system – proof-of-work (PoW), proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-storage. PoW are called Founder Nodes, which are tier-1 nodes based on 50,000 fully-owned NFTs. These are early supporters of the network, and will receive NFTs from all subsequent games and GALA allocated to their node license. PoS are paid nodes that operate for specific games, through a smart contract “rental” structure. Proof-of-Storage are free nodes that will allow the games to be fully hosted on the node ecosystem, removing reliance on centralized hosting solutions like Amazon S3.\\xa0\\n\\nGALA is an Ethereum token that powers Gala Games, a platform for blockchain gaming. GALA is used as the medium of exchange between Gala Games participants. For example, it can be used to pay for in-game items.\\xa0\\n\\nGALA is a utility token which is used as the medium of exchange between participants in the Gala Games ecosystem. The goal of introducing GALA is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the Gala Games ecosystem (for example, payment of digital goods or in-game items). GALA does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in Gala Games, their respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking. GALA does not entitle holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities.

Although there are other games that are being developed on the GALA blockchain, further research is needed to determine whether the games are shariah compliant or not.\\xa0\\n\\nGala’s native token GALA is used as the main digital asset within the Gala Games ecosystem for purchasing items, peer-to-peer payments, rewarding nodes, and more.\\xa0\\n\\n30.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol:\\xa0\\n\\nMany scholars see gaming as something that is impermissible for various reasons. In order to determine if GALA is shariah compliant, each game that it provides must be screened.

Main Function of the Protocol:\\xa0\\n\\nMaker (MKR) is the governance token of the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol — respectively a decentralized organization and a software platform, both based on the Ethereum blockchain — that allows users to issue and manage the DAI stablecoin. MKR tokens act as a kind of voting share for the organization that manages DAI; while they do not pay dividends to their holders, they do give the holders voting rights over the development of Maker Protocol.\\xa0\\n\\nDai is easy to generate, access, and use. Users generate Dai by depositing collateral assets into Maker Vaults within the Maker Protocol. This is how Dai is entered into circulation and how users gain access to liquidity. Others obtain Dai by buying it from brokers or exchanges, or simply by receiving it as a means of payment.\\xa0\\n\\nOnce generated, bought, or received, Dai can be used in the same manner as any other cryptocurrency: it can be sent to others, used as payments for goods and services, and even held as savings through a feature of the Maker Protocol called the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), expected to appreciate in value in accordance with the success of DAI itself.\\xa0\\n\\n31.2. Description of the Protocol from Shariah Point of View:\\xa0\\n\\nMaker operates a dual token system MKR which is a governance token. And DAI which is a token created out of loans made by the platform to the users. The interest on these loans are paid through the stability fee. This stability fee should not be confused with a maintenance fee or service fee for using the Maker Vault. It is clear that the crypto deposits are used as collateral for borrowing DAI. Hence, if the collateralization ratio drops below 150% the trader’s collateral will be liquidated to pay off their loan.\\xa0\\n\\n31.3.

Main Function of the Protocol:\\xa0\\n\\nLoopring is a program designed to work on top of Ethereum’s blockchain (a layer 1, or base, blockchain). This means that Loopring seeks to make the experience of using Ethereum faster by processing elements of Ethereum transactions on its own network. The purpose of the protocol is to become a hybrid ecosystem. Among other things, it aims to facilitate centralized order-matching exchanges with decentralized on-chain order settlement exchanges.\\xa0\\n\\nThe protocol relies on the ring miners to fulfill the necessary tasks. Ring miners together with order rings help execute orders in exchange for rewards. Miners receive rewards paid as feed by traders or the margins for an order.\\xa0\\n\\n33.2. Description of the Protocol from Shariah Point of View:\\xa0\\n\\nLoopring’s aim is to facilitate transactions between parties, whether they are compliant or not with shariah. The LRC token powers the ecosystem and has 5 identified use cases:\\n\\nFees for Ring Miners/Relayers.\\n\\nTo participate in DAO governance activities and proposals.\\n\\nBurned in LRC Burn Rate.\\n\\nLock up to run a DEX on Loopring.\\n\\nDEX operators can stake to reduce fees on that DEX.\\xa0\\n\\nIn this regard, LRC token acts mainly as a utility token.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n33.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol:\\xa0\\n\\nThe platform is a generic platform and does not differentiate between halal and haram activities. The token does not seem to act as a medium of exchange and is relatively restricted to providing utilities. Therefore, the protocol and the token can be seen as shariah compliant.\\xa0\\n\\n34.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Loopring (LRC)', 'Official Website': 'https://loopring.org/#/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/loopring/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/loopring', 'Initial Assessment': 'Mufti Billal', 'Reviewer': 'Dr Farrukh Habib'}), Document(page_content=\"Polygon\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://polygon.technology/papers/\\xa0\\n\\n34.1. Main Function of the Protocol:\\xa0\\n\\nAt the center of Polygon’s vision is Ethereum, a platform that is home to a range of decentralized applications, ones where you can join virtual worlds, play games, buy art, and participate in a range of financial services. However, this much activity on its blockchain has rendered Ethereum almost unusable, as the cost of transmission is rising and traffic is becoming clogged.\\xa0\\n\\nPolygon bills itself as a layer-2 network, meaning it acts as an add-on layer to Ethereum that does not seek to change the original blockchain layer. Like its geometric namesake, Polygon has many sides, shapes, and uses and promises a simpler framework for building interconnected networks. Polygon wants to help Ethereum expand in size, security, efficiency, and usefulness and seeks to spur developers to bring enticing products to market all the quicker.\\xa0\\n\\nMATIC is the utility token of the Polygon network and is used for securing the chain through staking, participating in network governance and as a unit of payment for transaction fees on the network. Users can earn MATIC tokens by providing computational resources and services to the Polygon network. This can be done by validating transactions or for executing smart contracts on the network.\\xa0\\n\\nAdditionally, by owning and staking MATIC, users gain the ability to vote on network upgrades, with each vote being proportional to the amount of MATIC cryptocurrency they stake.\\xa0\\n\\n34.2. Description of the Protocol from Shariah Point of View:\\xa0\\n\\nPolygon is similar to Loopring and it's a generic platform with the aim of enhancing dApps built on Ethereum.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n34.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol:\\xa0\\n\\nThe platform is a generic platform and can be used for various activities. MATIC token is a hybrid token and because of its nature as a medium of exchange, it can be considered as permissible to trade.\\xa0\\n\\n35.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Polygon (MATIC)', 'Official Website': 'https://polygon.technology/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon', 'Initial Assessment': 'Mufti Billal', 'Reviewer': 'Dr Farrukh Habib'}), Document(page_content='Avalanche (AVAX)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://www.avalabs.org/\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://www.avalabs.org/whitepapers\\xa0\\n\\n35.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nAvalanche is a high throughput smart contract blockchain platform. Validators secure the network through a proof-of-stake consensus protocol. It is said to be fast, low cost, and environmentally friendly. It is a layer one blockchain that functions as a platform for decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks. In that sense, it is similar to the Ethereum network.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nIt offers a transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second while not compromising scalability. It aims to do so by having three individual blockchains: the X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. Each chain has a distinct purpose, so not all nodes validate all transactions. Avalanche blockchains even use different consensus mechanisms based on their use cases. It also uses bridges to connect with Ethereum.\\n\\nThe Exchange Chain (X-Chain) is employed to create and exchange the native AVAX tokens and other assets. Similar to the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum, these tokens follow a set of standardized rules. It uses the Avalanche consensus mechanism.\\xa0\\n\\nThe Contract Chain (C-Chain) hosts smart contracts and decentralized applications. It has its own Avalanche Virtual Machine, similar to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing developers to fork EVM-compatible DApps. It uses the Snowman consensus mechanism.\\xa0\\n\\nThe Platform Chain (P-Chain) coordinates network validators, tracks active subnets and enables the creation of new subnets. Subnets are sets of validators, sort of like a validator cartel. Each subnet can be validating several blockchains, but a blockchain can only be validated by one subnet. It also uses the Snowman consensus mechanism.\\xa0\\n\\n$AVAX is the native token of Avalanche. It is a hard-capped, scarce asset that is used to pay for fees, secure the platform through staking, and provide a basic unit of account between the multiple subnets created on Avalanche. Fees are not paid to any specific validator. Instead, they are burned, thus increasing scarcity of the $AVAX.\\xa0\\n\\n35.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nAVAX is a decentralized open-source blockchain system. It works as a platform for numerous other blockchain projects, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts. In this way, it is a shariah neutral platform which can be used for mixed purposes.\\xa0\\n\\n$AVAX is a payment token that is used: (1) to pay gas at the platform, (2) to secure the network through staking, and (3) to serve as a unit of account. In this way, the native cryptocurrency of the platform, $AVAX, also seems to be shariah neutral.\\xa0\\n\\n35.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nBased on the analysis, AVAX platform and $AVAX token can be considered shariah compliant.\\xa0\\n\\n36.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Avalanche (AVAX)', 'Official Website': 'https://www.avax.network/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Wrapped AVAX (WAVAX)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://www.avalabs.org/\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://www.avalabs.org/whitepapers\\xa0\\n\\n36.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThe underlying platform of Wrapped AVAX (WAVAX) is Avalanche, which is a high throughput smart contract blockchain platform. Validators secure the network through a proof-of-stake consensus protocol. It is said to be fast, low cost, and environmentally friendly. It is a layer one blockchain that functions as a platform for decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks. In that sense, it is similar to the Ethereum network.\\xa0\\n\\nAvalanche’s native token $AVAX conforms to ARC20 token standard. However, if someone wants to transfer AVAX to Ethereum blockchain using a bridge then the token needs to be “wrapped”. It would become Wrapped AVAX (WAVAX), which is a token that represents AVAX 1:1 and conforms to the ERC20. It allows for increased functionality across any application that handles ERC20 tokens. You can always convert your WAVAX to AVAX 1:1 and vice versa.\\xa0\\n\\nIn order to use AVAX on the Ethereum network, you will first need to wrap it, to WAVAX, before sending it across the Avalanche-Ethereum bridge.\\xa0\\n\\n36.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nA wrapped token is completely dependent on the underlying token in its nature, price, objectives, and functions. The only difference is that it can be used on a different blockchain platform. WAVAX would take up the same shariah description of AVAX.\\xa0\\n\\n36.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nSince AVAX is shariah compliant, WAVAX can be considered as shariah compliant as well.\\xa0\\n\\n37.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Wrapped AVAX (WAVAX)', 'Official Website': 'https://www.avax.network/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wavax/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-avax', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Pangolin (PNG)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://docs.pangolin.exchange/\\xa0\\n\\n37.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nPangolin is a decentralized exchange (DEX) which runs on Avalanche, for Avalanche and Ethereum assets with fast settlement, low transaction fees, and a democratic distribution. It uses the same automated market-making (AMM) model as Uniswap.\\xa0\\n\\nPangolin aims to finalize trades quickly and cheaply. Since Pangolin is built on Avalanche, it enables users to swap assets while the transactions can be finalized within a fraction of a second. The transaction fees can be as low as a few cents.\\xa0\\n\\nIt features a native governance token called PNG that is fully community distributed and can trade all tokens issued on Ethereum and Avalanche. It enables the community to drive the development of the product in full. Community-distributed token means it follows 100% community-focused token distribution model, meaning that all tokens are distributed directly to the community, without any allocations to team, advisors, investors, or insiders.\\xa0\\n\\nPNG allows the holders to decide on: (1) modifications to the liquidity pools, and (2) fee switch. The community will also have the ability to enable the Pangolin fee switch. This fee switch can divert .05% of all swap fees to a designated address. Swap fees will remain fixed at .30%, but liquidity providers will only receive at most .25% of these fees. This provides the community with the opportunity to acquire extra funds to support any significant community initiatives. The Pangolin fee switch is subject to a 90-day timelock delay and is disabled by default.\\xa0\\n\\nPangolin allows token holders to add liquidity to pools or create their own liquidity pools. After token holders successfully create a pool or add liquidity to an existing pool, they receive PGL tokens. These tokens are a representation of their ownership in a pool. They may use those PGL tokens to earn the PNG governance token by depositing them into one of their participating pools.\\xa0\\n\\nAfter depositing their PGL tokens into a pool, they will accrue PNG tokens. Later they can claim their earned PNG tokens.\\xa0\\n\\n37.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nPangolin DEX is a mixed activity platform, where users can exchange/swap both halal and haram assets. If a user uses this platform to swap halal tokens then the usage is considered shariah compliant. Similarly, if a liquidity provider provides halal tokens or participates in only halal tokens pools, and receives PGL tokens for providing liquidity. It is considered shariah compliant. The fee collected as a profit will also be shariah compliant.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nPNG token is a governance token that entitles its holder the right to vote and decide on taking certain actions. In this way, it is also considered shariah compliant.\\xa0\\n\\n37.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nPangolin DEX and PNG token can be considered shariah compliant, however, it does not mean that all the activities, i.e., liquidity providing, staking, liquidity mining, and other activities would automatically become shariah compliant. Moreover, not all pools or tokens available on the DEX can be considered as shariah compliant.\\xa0\\n\\n38.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Pangolin (PNG)', 'Official Website': 'https://pangolin.exchange/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pangolin/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pangolin', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='USD Coin Avalanche Bridged (USDC.e)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/9304636/PDF/centre-whitepaper.pdf\\xa0\\n\\n38.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\n38.1.1. What is USDC?\\xa0\\n\\nUSDC.e is based on USDCoin. USD Coin (known by its ticker USDC) is a stablecoin that is pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis. Every unit of this cryptocurrency in circulation is backed up by $1 that is held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. The Centre consortium, which is behind the USDC, says it is issued by regulated financial institutions.\\xa0\\n\\nOverall, the goal of USDC is to create an ecosystem where USDC is accepted as a currency by as many wallets, exchanges, service providers and dApps as possible. The unique feature of USDC is transparency — and giving users the assurance that they will be able to withdraw 1 USDC and receive $1 in return without any issues. To this end, it says a major accounting firm is tasked with verifying the levels of cash that are held in reserve, and ensuring this matches up with the number of tokens in circulation.\\xa0\\n\\nIt is like USDT, but with more transparency. Unlike USDT, Circle and Coinbase have also achieved regulatory compliance — and this has helped pave the way for international expansion. Both projects are also well-funded, giving the stablecoin certainty.\\xa0\\n\\n38.1.2. USDC on Other Blockchains, Like Avalanche\\xa0\\n\\nRecently (December 2021), Circle announced the launch of USDCoin (USDC) on Avalanche (“Avalanche USDC”), which is the native USDC token on the Avalanche blockchain (specifically, Avalanche C-Chain). Circle customers are able to mint native Avalanche USDC from the Circle Account and Circle APIs. Similar to other native USDC tokens on other blockchains, you can deposit Avalanche USDC back into a Circle Account and off-ramp to fiat currency seamlessly.\\xa0\\n\\n38.1.3. Avalanche Bridges and Tokens\\xa0\\n\\nAvalanche has introduced their new bridge called Avalanche Bridge (AB). It is replacing the existing Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge (AEB). The AEB is now deactivated and Avalanche has stopped the transfers across it. The users who have assets on the AEB can now migrate them to the AB and continue to use them on the applications on the Avalanche ecosystem.\\xa0\\n\\nThe AB is expected to provide users with a better user experience, faster transactions and lower fees. Each Avalanche bridge now has its own unique token sets. Since Avalanche has deprecated the AEB tokens in favor of the AB tokens, they have decided to name AB tokens with a “.e” suffix.\\xa0\\n\\n38.1.4. What is USDC.e\\xa0\\n\\nAs USDC on AEB has now become a token from this deprecated bridge, Avalanche has named the USDC tokens that are running on the new AB as “USDC.e”. Same goes with other assets (like USDT) on the AB.\\xa0\\n\\nUSDC.e on Avalanche is a \"bridged form of Ethereum USDC\" that was bridged from the Ethereum blockchain via the Avalanche Bridge. For this reason, USDC.e is not the same as native USDC on Ethereum or Avalanche. Circle products do not support USDC.e. You cannot send USDC.e to a Circle deposit address. To elaborate, it is not possible to use USDC.e in the Circle APIs, nor deposit USDC.e into a Circle Account and off-ramp back to fiat currency.\\xa0\\n\\nYou need to convert (“unbridge”) USDC.e into either USDC Ethereum (or USDC Avalanche?) before using it on the Circle platform. However, USDC.e can be directly used on Avalanche.\\xa0\\n\\n38.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nUSDC.e is like a wrapped token which is brought from Ethereum blockchain to Avalanche through “bridging”. Other than the technical aspect, it seems to be completely dependent on the underlying token in its nature, price, objectives, and functions. The only difference is that it can be used on a different blockchain platform. USDC.e would take up the same shariah description of USDC.\\xa0\\n\\nUSDC.e is a form of currency which is backed by off chain dollar reserves. It is meant to be used as a digital payment system. All the shariah rulings of a currency are applicable on it.\\xa0\\n\\n38.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nDepending on the shariah ruling of USDC, it can be safely opined that USDC.e is also shariah compliant.\\xa0\\n\\n39.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'USD Coin Avalanche Bridged (USDC.e)', 'Official Website': 'https://www.centre.io/usdc', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin-avalanche-bridged-usdc-e', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='PancakeSwap (CAKE)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://docs.pancakeswap.finance/\\xa0\\n\\n39.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nPancakeSwap is an automated market maker (AMM) — a decentralized finance (DeFi) application that allows users to exchange tokens, provide liquidity via farming and earn fees in return. In other words, it is a decentralized exchange for swapping BEP20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain.\\xa0\\n\\nWhen users provide liquidity, they earn LP tokens. These LP tokens can later be used by the liquidity providers to reclaim their share of the pool, as well as a portion of the trading fees. PancakeSwap also allows users to farm additional tokens such as CAKE and SYRUP. On the farm, users can deposit LP tokens and get rewarded with CAKE.\\xa0\\n\\nCAKE is the governance token for PancakeSwap. The supply of CAKE is not hard-capped. Theoretically, CAKE’s supply is unlimited. Users can earn CAKE from Farms and Syrup Pools, win it in the lottery, or buy it on the exchange. The main uses of CAKE are:\\n\\nStake it in Syrup Pools to earn free tokens - stake CAKE to earn tokens of other projects.\\xa0\\n\\nUse it in Yield Farms to earn more CAKE - stake CAKE to earn more CAKE.\\xa0\\n\\nBuy Lottery tickets in the PancakeSwap Lottery and pay with CAKE\\xa0\\n\\nParticipate in IFO (initial farm offering) Token Sales\\xa0\\n\\nCreate your Pancake Profile and mint NFTs\\xa0\\n\\nVote on proposals relating to the PancakeSwap ecosystem\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n39.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nCAKE is mainly a governance token which means that it is based on a voting right. However, it is a hybrid token because it is also used for staking and to pay for lottery tickets. Through IFO, a new project gets the CAKE, PancakeSwap burns the participation fees CAKE, and the user gets the tokens. Therefore, the user will need CAKE to participate in the IFOs.\\xa0\\n\\n39.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nPancakeSwap is a mixed activity DEX because some crypto assets are halal, and some are haram. Other than swapping, other activities on the DEX are also mixed.\\xa0\\n\\nAs a governance and payment token, CAKE seems to be shariah compliant because there is no explicitly haram factor as part of it. Though, it is used for shariah non-compliant purposes, i.e., to buy lottery tickets, however, this can be seen as an external factor, and it is not the only use case of CAKE. Users can own CAKE and use it for halal transactions.\\n\\n40.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'PancakeSwap (CAKE)', 'Official Website': 'https://pancakeswap.finance/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pancakeswap', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content=\"Frax (FRAX)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://docs.frax.finance/overview\\xa0\\n\\n40.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nFrax is a protocol for a decentralized on-chain monetary system. The Frax protocol is a two token system encompassing a stablecoin, Frax (FRAX), and a governance token, Frax Shares (FXS).\\xa0\\n\\nThe stable coin (FRAX) is a currency token, and has parts of its supply backed by collateral and parts of the supply as algorithmic. The protocol also has a pool contract which holds USDC collateral. Pools can be added or removed with governance.\\xa0\\n\\nFRAX stablecoins can be minted by placing the appropriate amount of its constituent parts into the system. At genesis, FRAX is 100% collateralized, meaning that minting FRAX only requires placing collateral into the minting contract. During the fractional phase, minting FRAX requires placing the appropriate ratio of collateral and burning the ratio of Frax Shares (FXS). The ratio of collateralized and algorithmic depends on the market's pricing of the FRAX stablecoin. If FRAX is trading at above $1, the protocol decreases the collateral ratio. If FRAX is trading at under $1, the protocol increases the collateral ratio.\\xa0\\n\\nThe supply of the FRAX stablecoin is dynamic and always changing to keep the price at $1 due to its fractional-algorithmic monetary policy. If the market price is above the price target of $1, then there is an arbitrage opportunity to mint tokens by placing $1 of value into the system per FRAX and sell the minted FRAX for above $1 in the open market. The difference is simply the proportion of FXS and collateral comprising the $1 of value. If the market price of FRAX is below the price range of $1, then there is an arbitrage opportunity to redeem FRAX tokens by purchasing cheaply on the open market and redeeming FRAX for $1 of value from the system. At all times, a user is able to redeem FRAX for $1 worth of value from the system. The difference is simply what proportion of the collateral and FXS is returned to the redeemer.\\xa0\\n\\n40.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nFRAX is a payment/currency token that partially uses reserves of other on-chain stable coins, and partially uses algorithms to stabilize its price/value against USD. FRAX can be minted and redeemed from the system for $1 of value, allowing arbitrageurs to balance the demand and supply of FRAX in the open market. At all times in order to mint new FRAX a user must place $1 worth of value into the system.\\xa0\\n\\nHowever, it may not remain shariah compliant after the introduction of V2. The docs of Frax indicate that Frax can have multiple pools of collateral and multiple algorithmic token pools with weights, similar to Balancer. The protocol currently has USDC collateral pools and just 1 algorithmic token: FXS. In v2, we will release a second algorithmic token, the Frax Bond token (FXB) which represents pure debt with an interest rate attached.\\xa0\\n\\n40.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nGiven that USDT, USDC and other stable coins are considered as shariah compliant, FRAX also seems to be a shariah compliant payment token, because other stable coins are used as collateral. Moreover, FXS also seems to play its role in stabilizing the price of FRAX. FXS as a governance token also seems to be shariah compliant, so there is no shariah issue.\\xa0\\n\\nHowever, a fresh assessment would be needed when V2 is launched to check its shariah status again.\\xa0\\n\\n41.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Frax (FRAX)', 'Official Website': 'https://frax.finance/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/frax/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/frax', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Rai Reflex Index (RAI)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://docs.reflexer.finance/\\xa0\\n\\n41.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nReflexer is a smart contract lending platform that allows anyone to use their crypto collateral and take out loans in the form of RAI. It was founded by Reflexer Labs in mid 2020 as an initiative to introduce control theory in the crypto space and revive the old vision that was supposed to be implemented for DAI: build a stable currency with no peg and managed by an on-chain, smart contract based controller.\\xa0\\n\\nRAI claims that DAI was not supposed to be pegged to anything. Rather, it was meant to have a floating target price (aka moving peg) that changes according to what the market price of DAI is on secondary markets. The simplest way to describe the mechanism is that the target price would start to go up when the market price of DAI was below it and, in the scenario where the market price was above the target, the target price would start to go down. This would compel market participants to bring DAI’s market price back and close to the target price. This whole mechanism is now the main driving force behind RAI.\\xa0\\n\\nRai is a kind of stable coin. It is a non-pegged, ETH backed stable asset built by Reflexer. It is the first asset of its kind that, instead of being pegged to a specific target such as the USD, it freely floats while it is being influenced by market forces. RAI’s mission is to become a crypto native and governance minimized stable asset that is detached from fiat. It is a unique stable currency that has an intrinsic rate which can be either positive or negative. Holders and traders can take advantage of this rate while at the same time stabilize RAI.\\xa0\\n\\n41.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nReflexer has a complex mechanism to achieve stability and also has a complicated issuance system for RAI tokens. However, it is understood that the users first need to provide collateral and take a loan in the form of RAI, that is how RAI is issued. It is an upshot of DAI protocol with sort of an improvement regarding pegging.\\xa0\\n\\nMinting Rai incurs debt as well as exposes the minter to the effects of the redemption rate, which is the rate at which Rai is de or revalued. RAI works similarly to Multi Collateral Dai: every collateral type has its own specific stability fee. Stability fees accrue in the protocol’s balance sheet and from there, governance or an autonomous smart contract can decide how they are used. Furthermore, it is suspected that the debt-based issuance of RAI would involve interest or Riba. Although it is not directly stated in the docs, the main website clearly mentions: “RAI is an ETH backed stable asset. You can use it to take out loans against your ETH at a small interest rate.”\\xa0\\n\\n41.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nIt seems that the issuance of RAI token involves interest-based collateralized debt, which is not a halal transaction. Therefore, RAI does not seem to be halal.\\xa0\\n\\n42\\u200b\\u200b. \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://curve.fi/files/CurveDAO.pdf\\xa0\\n\\n42.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nCurve is a decentralized exchange for stablecoins that uses an automated market maker (AMM) and hence uses liquidity pools. Similar to Uniswap, Curve Finance is an AMM-based DEX; but unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value (stablecoin). However, Curve V2 can also offer swaps among ETH, BTC, and other non-stable coins.\\xa0\\n\\nAny transaction on every Curve pool generates fees, a portion of which accrue to the liquidity providers who have provided the liquidity in the pool. There is an extra reward offered by Curve on top of the fees. The LP tokens entitle liquidity providers to earn bonus CRV emissions. Some pools (Compound, PAX, Y, BUSD) also earn interest from lending protocols, because they have yield-bearing tokens as liquidity. Behind the scenes, those four pools also use lending protocols (like Compound or AAVE) to help generate more interest for liquidity providers.\\xa0\\n\\nCurve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it has collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield.\\xa0\\n\\nAnother feature of the Curve protocol is MetaPools, which allows users to swap LP tokens of pool with another token (e.g. BUSD and 3Pool LP tokens).\\xa0\\n\\nCurve launched a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with CRV as its in-house token. CRV token is a governance and utility token for Curve. The main purposes of the CRV token are to incentivize liquidity providers on the Curve Finance platform as well as to get as many users involved as possible in the governance of the protocol.\\xa0\\n\\nCurrently CRV has three main uses: voting, staking and boosting. Those three things will require you to lock (stake) your CRV and acquire veCRV. veCRV stands for vote-escrowed CRV, it is simply CRV locked for a period of time. The longer you lock CRV for, the more veCRV you receive. veCRV is not a token, but an arbitrary number or a coefficient to show the voting power.\\xa0\\n\\nIt has implemented a complex time-based staking system to convert CRV to veCRV, where veCRV is an internal token (non-tradable without monetary value) intended for governance purpose and has a right to claim the cash flows generated by the protocol.\\xa0\\n\\nStaking (trading fee): A 50% admin fee on all trading fees is collected by the Curve Protocol. Those fees are collected and used to buy 3CRV, the LP token for the TriPool, which are then distributed to veCRV holders.\\xa0\\n\\nBoosting: Vote locking CRV allows you to acquire voting power to participate in the DAO and earn a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity you are providing on Curve.\\xa0\\n\\nVoting: Once CRV holders vote-lock their veCRV, they can start voting on various DAO proposals and pool parameters.\\xa0\\n\\nIn a nutshell, Curve users provide liquidity in different pools, and collect a portion of fees in the form of the same tokens as in the pool. The users can then stake LP tokens to receive CRV. Curve finance protocol converts its portion of fees collected from different pools into stablecoins and provides liquidity with those stablecoins in certain pools (3pools, 2pools, etc.), \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200band the fee generated is then distributed to the users who stake LP tokens. Users can further stake CRV to acquire veCRV and participate in the governance process and also get a reward boost on their fees.\\xa0\\n\\n42.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nCRV is mainly a governance and utility token of the Curve protocol. It is used for voting, staking, and boosting rewards. In this sense, there seems to be no shariah issue. Although there are few shariah issues. For example, the presence of lending pools, and the possibility of earning interest may pose some shariah issues. Moreover, it also has Y-pools that are connected with Compound, Yearn.Finance and other interest-based pools. It also facilitates transactions through yield-bearing tokens, and users can also earn interest on those yield-bearing tokens. These factors may indirectly affect the value of the CRV token, ken, the extent of which is unknown. However, since the CRV token or its value is not directly related to those activities, CRV as merely a governance and utility token can be considered as a shariah compliant token. But, it does not mean that the Curve finance protocol or all other activities can be considered shariah compliant.\\xa0\\n\\nAll pools earn profit from trading fees, some pools also earn interest from lending and there are also some pools with extra incentives. However, note that lending pools are small in number.\\xa0\\n\\n42.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThe shariah status of Curve finance protocol is mixed because some activities are halal and some are haram. However, CRV as a governance and utility token is not directly related to those activities, rather it seeks its value from the whole system. The main factor for the value of CRV is to hold CRV for boosting the pools’ rewards through vote-locking ((veCRV). Its value is also determined by market factors. Therefore, CRV as a token can be considered shariah compliant, if it is used in shariah-compliant activities and transactions.\\xa0\\n\\n43.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'Curve DAO Token (CRV)', 'Name of the Token': 'Rai Reflex Index (RAI)', 'Official Website': 'https://reflexer.finance/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rai/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rai', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Convex Finance (CVX)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/\\xa0\\n\\n43.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nIn Curve Finance protocol (CRV), users can vote-lock (voting for governance) or stake their CRV tokens to receive veCRV. The holders of veCRV receive 3CRV (the LP token for the TriPool) as an incentive. The veCRV holders can also boost their fees up to 2.5x on the liquidity they provide on Curve, along with the voting right. However, the locking/staking of CRV tokens at Curve has fixed duration, i.e. 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 4 years. Hence, making it sticky.\\xa0\\n\\nConvex Finance tries to solve this problem. Convex is a DeFi protocol that allows Curve liquidity providers to earn a share of trading fees on Curve without directly staking liquidity there. In other words, Convex allows Curve LPs to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV on the Curve protocol themselves. Instead, LPs can stake with Convex and receive boosted CRV and liquidity mining rewards. This provides CRV stakers a flexible duration (without time-lock).\\xa0\\n\\nCRV rewards can go as high as 2.5X of the initial rewards, but the higher the liquidity deposited, the more difficult it is to attain the maximum rewards. In fact, it is nearly impossible for any individual or single party to stake enough liquidity at Curve to attain the maximum boost, which is where Convex Finance comes in. Convex acts as an intermediary that pools the assets of individual stakers and benefits from their aggregated liquidity. Even low-level investors can stake their Curve Finance LPs with Convex and receive boosted rewards that would otherwise not be attainable. By staking with Convex, they receive:\\xa0\\n\\nA portion of the transaction fee of Convex itself in CRV\\xa0\\n\\nA share of the Curve trading fees (3CRV)\\xa0\\n\\nliquid cvxCRV allowing anyone to exit their staked CRV position\\xa0\\n\\nReceive CVX tokens\\xa0\\n\\nClaim veCRV airdrops\\xa0\\n\\nCRV stakers and liquidity providers also receive liquidity mining rewards in the form of CVX. Convex charges performance fees which are used to pay for gas and distributed to CVX stakers.\\xa0\\n\\nCVX is the native platform token for Convex. It is a utility (staking) and governance token. CVX is rewarded to CRV stakers and Curve liquidity pools pro-rata to CRV generated by the platform. If a user is in a high CRV rewards liquidity pool he will receive more CVX for his contribution. CVX is also distributed to cvxCRV/CRV and CVX/ETH LPs that stake their LP tokens on the Convex platform through a MasterChef staking rewards contract.\\xa0\\n\\nStaking: CVX can be staked on Convex Finance to earn a share of Curve LP\\'s CRV earnings. Those earnings are locked in veCRV and tokenized as cvxCRV and given to the CVX stakers. In this way, CVX stakers can earn Curve LP’s RV portion of the fees as cvxCRV (tokenized veCRV). Stakers of CVX also receive additional fees from Curve and FRAX finance LPs.\\xa0\\n\\nVoting: CVX is used for voting on how Convex Finance allocates its veCRV towards Curve.fi gauge weight votes. Users must vote-lock their CVX tokens in order to participate. The Curve system allows veCRV holders to vote how CRV inflation is distributed by assigning weights to each pool\\'s \"gauge\". As a holder of veCRV, Convex Finance can participate in these voting procedures, and these voting rights are passed to vote locked CVX holders.\\xa0\\n\\n43.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nCVX is mainly a governance and utility token of the Convex protocol. It is used for voting, staking, and boosting rewards. In this sense, there seems to be no shariah issue. However, the protocol seems to be a secondary layer on top of the Curve protocol. This layer has been built to address the inherent issues with the Curve protocol. In this sense, it also entails the same shariah issues as the Curve protocol has.\\xa0\\n\\nHowever, since the CVX token or its value is not directly related to those shariah non-compliant activities, CVX as merely a governance and utility token can be considered as a shariah compliant token. But, it does not mean that the Convex finance protocol as a whole or all other activities can be considered shariah compliant.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n43.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThe shariah status of the Convex protocol is mixed because of two reasons. (1) Some activities on the underlying protocol (Curve Finance) are re halal and some are haram. (2) Besides the token, other activities are too complex to be evaluated in this report. However, CVX as a governance and utility token is not directly related to those activities, rather it seeks its value from the whole system. The main factor for the value of CVX is to hold CVX for boosting the pools’ rewards through veCRV. Its value is also determined by market factors. Therefore, CVX as a token can be considered shariah compliant, if it is used in shariah-compliant activities and transactions.\\xa0\\n\\n44.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'Convex Finance (CVX)', 'Official Website': 'https://www.convexfinance.com/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/convex-finance/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/convex-finance', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='UMA (UMA)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOfficial Documents Link:\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nhttps://docs.umaproject.org/\\xa0\\n\\n44.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nUMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. An optimistic oracle serves data to smart contracts using a \"true unless disputed\" escalation game.\\xa0\\n\\nWhat is UMA and Optimistic Oracle?\\xa0\\n\\nOracles are a key part of blockchain infrastructure. They enable communication between the external world and on-chain environments in a trustless manner. Oracles are vital for many parts of the blockchain industry including decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 applications.\\xa0\\n\\nAn optimistic oracle (OO) like UMA\\'s uses a “true unless disputed” pattern, with a tokenholder vote to resolve disputes. Anyone can propose an answer to a data request, and it is accepted as true if it is not disputed during a verification period. The “optimistic” design differs from a price-feed oracle, where prices are streamed on-chain and are instantly final.\\xa0\\n\\nThis optimistic oracle (OO) design concept has been in development since 2014, when Vitalik first published on the matter. There have been several iterations over the years since then. The optimistic design pattern introduces the opportunity for human intelligence to weigh in. This is important for Web3 projects as they require arbitrary data that is not always possible to turn into code.\\xa0\\n\\nToday, the OO provides flexible, unique dispute resolution involving any kind of question or data with human input, as compared to price feed oracles, which can only push regular price updates onto chains.\\xa0\\n\\nHow Does UMA Work?\\xa0\\n\\nUMA\\'s Optimistic Oracle allows contracts to quickly request and receive data information. The Optimistic Oracle acts as a generalized escalation game between contracts that initiate a price request and UMA\\'s dispute resolution system known as the Data Verification Mechanism (DVM). Prices proposed by the Optimistic Oracle will not be sent to the DVM unless it is disputed. This enables contracts to obtain price information within any pre-defined length of time without the need to have the price of an asset written on-chain.\\xa0\\n\\nIf a dispute is raised, a request is sent to the DVM. All contracts built on UMA use the DVM as a backstop to resolve disputes. Disputes sent to the DVM will be resolved 48 hours after UMA tokenholders vote on the price of the asset at a given time.\\xa0\\n\\nUMA’s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets. UMA\\'s oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. The Across bridge, Polymarket prediction markets, and Outcome.Finance DAO tools are all secured by UMA’s optimistic oracle.\\xa0\\n\\nVoting:\\xa0\\n\\nThe UMA voting process requires tokenholders to commit and reveal their votes in two separate stages. Each stage is open for 24 hours, so each voting period is 48 hours. Examples of governance proposals include:\\xa0\\n\\nApproving new price identifiers and collateral currencies\\xa0\\n\\nPrice requests and disputes\\xa0\\n\\nUpgrading the core DVM protocol and / or modify DVM parameters\\xa0\\n\\nRegistering and de-registering contract templates\\xa0\\n\\nShutting down contract instantiations (in rare circumstances)\\xa0\\n\\nUMA Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThe UMA token is primarily a governance token used to contribute to UMA protocol decisions, such as voting on UMA Improvement Proposals (UMIPs), price requests, and disputes made to UMA\\'s Data Verification Mechanism (DVM).\\xa0\\n\\nAll UMA token owners can participate in UMA’s optimistic oracle. UMA’s token is built on Ethereum that can be held in wallets like Metamask, Trezor, or Ledger, which must be connected to the UMA voting Dapp to enable voting.\\xa0\\n\\nUMA’s community of token holders provide the human component, as voters, for the OO\\'s final resolution on disputes or queries. Tokens are also used to vote on protocol upgrades and UMA DAO funds allocations. The strength of the token will track with the strength and adoption of the UMA ecosystem as a whole. Active and accurate voters earn a healthy yield for their participation.\\xa0\\n\\n44.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nUMA is a protocol that provides a method and service of data verification and data insertion on blockchain. This data then can be used to develop different products and services in the web3 and Defi space.\\xa0\\n\\nUMA token is a governance token where the token holders can vote for any dispute about verification and insertion of data, and get incentivize. They can also vote for further improvements and upgrades in the system. In this way, UMA token holders ensure that the platform remains secured.\\xa0\\n\\n44.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThe purpose UMA platform serves and the service it offers seem to be shariah-compliant. The UMA token, as a governance token, also seem to be shariah-compliant. However, it does not mean that staking and voting of UMA is also shariah-compliant automatically. These processes should be evaluated separately. Moreover, any product or service based on UMA’s Optimistic Oracle should also be independently reviewed.\\xa0\\n\\n45.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'UMA (UMA)', 'Official Website': 'https://umaproject.org/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uma/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uma', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Trust Wallet (TWT)\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhitepaper Link:\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n45.1.

It is based on automated market making (AMM). Overall, 1INCH consists of different protocols and products, which are:\\xa0\\n\\nAggregation Protocol:\\xa0\\n\\nThe 1inch Aggregation Protocol facilitates cost-efficient and secure swap transactions across multiple liquidity sources.\\xa0\\n\\nLimit Order Protocol:\\xa0\\n\\nIt offers limit order functionality for 1INCH, for instance, stop loss and trailing stop orders. This protocol can also be used for auctions. For instance, Maker DAO’s Liquidation 2.0 Module is based on the auction model, and users could take part in Maker DAO auctions, using the 1inch Limit Order Protocol.\\xa0\\n\\nLiquidity Protocol:\\xa0\\n\\n1INCH also has liquidity protocol which is based on AMM. To earn from their crypto assets' holdings, users can provide liquidity to 1inch pools. Liquidity providers collect rewards on assets locked in pools and extra yield farming rewards in 1INCH tokens. To participate in liquidity mining programs and earn 1INCH tokens, a user needs to be a liquidity provider to one of the 1inch pools supported by the program.\\xa0\\n\\n1inch Earn:\\xa0\\n\\nIt is a derivative-based product offering liquidity providers APYs. 1inch Earn offers liquidity providers APYs through the use of capital. It is a kind of staking program, where stakers earn APR as long as the 1INCH token price stays below the strike price. Each week the pools are rebalanced and strike price might be updated.\\xa0\\n\\n1INCH Wallet:\\xa0\\n\\nThe 1inch Wallet is a multichain mobile platform that provides an easy-to-navigate interface with secure storing, transaction, and staking capabilities. With this wallet, users can:\\xa0\\n\\nBuy crypto with a bank card using 1INCH’s partner fiat gateway providers,\\xa0\\n\\nStore/keep cryptos,\\xa0\\n\\nTransfer crypto in multiple blockchain networks,\\xa0\\n\\nSwap tokens,\\xa0\\n\\nStake 1INCH to participate in network governance and be eligible for gas costs refunds.\\xa0\\n\\n1INCH Token:\\xa0\\nThe 1inch Network's governance token 1INCH is used to vote on protocol parameters under the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model. The 1INCH token is the governance and utility token of the 1inch Network. The token is applied in different capacities in the two existing protocols and will be used in the tokenomics of all new protocols released by the 1inch Network. 1INCH is a multichain token, currently available on Ethereum and on BNB Chain over a bridge.\\xa0\\n\\nCurrently, the main application of 1INCH as a utility token is in the 1inch Liquidity Protocol where it is used as a connector to achieve high-efficiency routing.\\xa0\\n\\nThe 1INCH token is used to govern all of the 1inch Network's current and future protocols. It is utilized in the governance modules of the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and the 1inch Liquidity Protocol.\\xa0\\n\\n46.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\n1INCH as DEX aggregator has mixed activities because it allows shariah-compliant and non-compliant transactions both. Limit order protocol seems to be a shariah neutral tool because it adds other features and functionality for trading. Liquidity protocol is also mixed activity because it facilitates all sorts of pools that consist of halal/haram pairs. 1INCH Earn does not seem to be shariah-compliant. The wallet is an interface/gateway to access the features of 1INCH.\\xa0\\n\\n1INCH token is a utility and governance token of the protocol. Users can stake 1INCH token to participate in the governance and get incentivized through rewards. Moreover, users can use 1INCH to enjoy reduced gas fee.\\xa0\\n\\n46.3.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n1.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nBrickken aims at two objectives. Firstly, Brickken wants to create a decentralized management system that allows companies to self-sustain, self-governed, and self-fund themselves via Security Token Offerings (STOs). Second, Brickken aims to provide Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) with the infrastructure necessary to operate. The goal is for any business to be able to tokenize its assets and run in a native Web3 environment. Brickken will be providing the infrastructure to allow new economic dynamics to exist, Business to DAO (B2D), DAO to Business (D2B), and DAO to DAO (D2D).\\n\\nBrickken will bring companies’ capital on-chain, through the tokenization process. Companies on the blockchain could manage their equity in a more efficient way and in addition issue Security Token Offerings as a crowdfunding mechanism for their own capital, or for any assets they have or want to acquire, without the need for intermediaries.\\n\\nThe dApp provides the necessary tools for managing the companies on-chain, from secondary market transactions to voting polls and all the necessary tools for administrating token-holders and the company holdings.\\n\\nThis protocol facilitates the transition from off-chain and on-chain and serves the purposes of providing the needed infrastructure for DAOs to operates as well.\\n\\n1.1.2. The Token\\n\\nBKN is an ERC-20 token which is claimed to be a utility token. BKN will fuel all the transactions made using the Brickken decentralized protocol:\\n\\nPayment of the protocol’s issuance fee\\n\\nOne of the payments methods for investing in Token Offerings\\n\\nThe payment method for liquidating any service provided by an Expert from Brickken’s ecosystem.\\n\\nOn top of that, there are several uses of BKN in the ecosystem from various aspects:\\n\\nIssuers of token offerings: fee payment in BKN, subscription fee, lending mechanism\\n\\nBrickken's community: participation in DAO, access to features from Brickken & token issuers\\n\\nStaking incentives - a collateralized tokenization: stake BKN and earn rewards.\\n\\nInvestors of token offerings: invest in STOs through BKN, discount/cashback in BKN, earn dividends in BKN.\\n\\nBrickken's partners: earn commission in BKN for referrals, price for services, etc.\\n\\n1.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBrickken is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates companies to tokenize their assets or offer equity through STOs. The platform also offers tools to facilitate primary and secondary market activities. In this sense, it is a service platform for companies raising funds through equity offering.\\n\\nBKN token is a hybrid token that acts as a payment system of the protocol because it can be used to pay fees, earn commission, and receive dividends. It can also be seen as a governance token because of its staking mechanism. It is also a utility token because it offers discounts.\\n\\n1.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBrickken is a neutral platform from the shariah perspective because it helps companies to tokenize their assets or do STOs. BKN token is also neutral because it does not have any intrinsic prohibited element. Therefore, the protocol and token both are shariah compliant. However, it does not mean that all the STOs and token investment project on Brickken will automatically become shariah compliant. They must go through a separate review process. Moreover, other staking, yield farming, and token investment programs should also be reviewed for shariah compliance separately.\\n\\n2.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'Brickken (BKN)', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee', 'Review Date': '08 March 2023'}), Document(page_content='The Republic Note (NOTE)\\n\\nName of the Token\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nCoinGecko Link\\n\\nNot available\\n\\nCoinMarketCap Link\\n\\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/the-republic-note/\\n\\nOfficial Website\\n\\nhttps://republic.com/note\\n\\nWhitepaper Link\\n\\nhttps://uploads.republic.co/p/documents/attachments/original/000/000/218/218-1593003895-3dd2ac189c69094946fa0e2bfcc8c312f80a5988.pdf\\n\\n08 March 2023\\n\\n2.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n2.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nRepublic is a U.S. based investment platform which focuses on democratizing access to private investing. It aims to create the private equity marketplace. Republic operates a public investment platform for retail investors from all backgrounds and a private investment platform for institutional and accredited investors only. Each platform typically receives two forms of compensation for their services: a cash commission or a fee, and a potential upside in the companies they help finance in the form of securities or carried interests.\\n\\n2.1.2. The Token\\n\\nThe Republic Note is a crypto token based on Algorand blockchain; there will be a wrapped Republic Note on Binance Chain in the future.\\n\\nIt will entitle its holders a share in Republic’s revenue from the realization of profits that Republic’s investment platforms earn when certain upside is realized if companies - past, present, and future - exit (i.e., get acquired or go public). Republic will offer periodic payouts to Republic Note holders in the form of dividends in stablecoin, to the extent practicable, if and when the proceeds from these exits reach a certain threshold amount. In other words, the Republic Note will be a profit-sharing digital asset that will provide its holders with economic rights to a portion of Republic’s future success.\\n\\nRepublic Note holders will not have direct legal ownership rights to the underlying companies that raise capital on or through Republic’s investment platforms, they will only receive their portions of the Core Proceeds, net of certain administration expenses and distribution costs. In other words, Republic Notes will entitle their holders to certain rights to portions of Republic Core’s future revenue and do not constitute legal ownership of or actual interests in Republic’s portfolio of startups. Republic Notes do not represent an investment in a fund. Because the timing and profitability (if any) of future liquidations of Republic Crowd-Invest securities and Republic Private Capital carried interests cannot be predicted, Republic Notes have no accurate valuation. Furthermore, as with most digital assets, to the extent Republic Notes may become tradable on a market, supply, and demand for them may result in significant price volatility. There is no accurate benchmark with which to value, or predict the future value of, the Republic Note.\\n\\nIt is a reward token as well because Republic intends for every Republic user to be able to earn Republic Notes as rewards for certain actions and behaviors. Users who grow their Republic Note balances will unlock new investment features, perks, and benefits. It encourages holders to further invest and encourages startups to raise money with Republic. Users will also be able to complete bounties to earn Republic Notes. The following are possible perks that will be unlocked by holding certain Republic Note balances: Priority waitlist, Access to notable investors, Swag and other perks.\\n\\n2.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIt is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates companies to raise funds through equity offering, STOs? The platform offers crowd investment services and share profit of those startups. In this sense, it is a service platform for companies raising funds through equity offering. However, it is not clear how risk management and loss distribution will take place. It is a neutral platform which facilitates all types of startups and companies, shariah compliant and non-compliant. \\n\\nNOTE token is a hybrid because it is a utility token with features of a security. It unlocks certain features, rewards its holders for certain actions, and discounts. On the other hand, it shares profits and dividends with its holders in stable coin from the portfolio of the startups and companies. This is something problematic from various aspects:\\n\\nThe startups and companies are mixed activities companies, their profits can be halal or haram.\\n\\nNote holders will receive cash profits without owning the startups, companies, or even the portfolio of Republic. They have a right on the profit Republic makes, but it is not clear under what legal structure this right will be realized. It seems that it is a mere promise to share profits with any partnership/investment arrangement.\\n\\n2.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nRepublic blockchain platform can be considered a neutral platform from the shariah perspective because it simply helps startups and companies raise funds through equity financing on the blockchain. But the underlying structure for the NOTE token is problematic. NOTE token has intrinsic structural element which is profit distribution without any partnership/ownership/investment in the underlying projects. Therefore, the token is shariah non-compliant, for the same reason, the protocol will also be affected and becomes shariah non-compliant.\\n\\n3.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee', 'Review Date': '09 March 2023'}), Document(page_content='Cookie3\\n\\nName of the Token\\n\\nCookie3\\n\\nCoinGecko Link\\n\\nNot Available\\n\\nCoinMarketCap Link\\n\\nNot Available\\n\\nOfficial Website\\n\\nhttps://cookie3.co/\\n\\nWhitepaper Link\\n\\nNot Available\\n\\n09 March 2023\\n\\n3.1.

Such algorithms will allow companies and brands to create behavioral profiles for targeted advertising and marketing campaigns.\\n\\nOverall, Cookie3 offers behavioral scoring, customer insights, personalization of web3, ads targeting, walletbook, and NFT personalization.\\n\\n3.1.2. The Token\\n\\nAccording to the Litepaper, $Cookie is a payment token that will be used for payment of all Cookie3 services. It is also a utility token because it will be distributed as rewards for stakers, discounts for services and products, and unlocking other features for the holders of the token.\\n\\nIt is also a governance token. It will be used for limited governance of the platform development, advisors, partnerships & cooperations, full governance of the DAO fund.\\n\\n3.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIt is a blockchain-based platform that offers on-chain data analytics as a service to new crypto projects. It helps them to understand the users’ behavior and focus their marketing campaigns on the targeted users. The token is a payment, utility, and governance token.\\n\\n3.3.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n4.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nHashflow is a decentralized exchange designed for interoperability, zero slippage, and MEV-protected trades. It allows you to trade any asset on any chain in seconds simply by connecting your wallet. All trades are commission-free, and all price quotes are executed at their displayed price, giving you the most value for your buck on every trade.\\n\\nHashflow offers fully-native cross-chain swap functionality without the use of bridges or synthetic assets, enabling seamless trading across one or more chains with guaranteed price execution.\\n\\nHashflow’s RFQ model allows Market Makers to price any asset class and is no longer limited to stable coins or blue-chip assets. This means Hashflow can offer seamless trading of other financial products (i.e., options, ETFs) that were previously impossible in DeFi. Hashflow has the following features:\\n\\nBridgeless Cross-Chain Swaps: Hashflow allows you to seamlessly swap assets across chains within minutes without the need for external bridges.\\n\\nZero Slippage: All Hashflow quotes are executed at the displayed price.\\n\\nMEV protected trades: Cryptographic signatures make front-running impossible. Traders can keep what they earn.\\n\\n4.1.2. Hashverse\\n\\nThe Hashverse is the story-driven, gamified DAO and governance platform, where you can stake tokens, complete quests, and earn rewards to shape the future of the Hashflow protocol.\\n\\nThe Hashverse creates an immersive experience for all users to unlock and complete quests, collect and trade in-game artifacts and loot items, upgrade their characters, and earn real rewards, all while helping to forge the future of the protocol.\\n\\n4.1.3. The Token\\n\\nHFT is the governance token for the Hashflow protocol as well as the Hashverse, Hashflow’s gamified DAO and governance platform. It will be an ERC-20 token deployed on Ethereum mainnet. It is also a utility token as:\\n\\nGovernance: Hashflow governance will follow a vote-escrow (ve) token model where voting rights are determined based on the amount of HFT staked as well as the duration for which HFT is locked. Staking tokens will grant users the right to vote and manage the future of the protocol. This includes decisions relating to protocol fees, marketing, and code development – Hashflow will be run by its community.\\n\\nIn-DAO Health & Rewards: Users can stake HFT in Hashverse. Staked tokens will be used to determine users’ health metrics within the Hashverse. Users must continuously adjust the amount and duration of their staked tokens to maintain their health within the Hashverse, as a way to increase engagement and actual usage. The protocol will continue to reward the most active members of the community and their Hashverse presence will play a major role in redeeming these rewards.\\n\\n4.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nIt is a blockchain-based DEX with some unique improvement, like zero slippage, no front-running, etc. It also has a governance system based on DAO. This DAO is gamified and follows a story to maintain users’ engagement. In this way, it is a neutral platform from the shariah perspective.\\n\\nHFT token is a utility and governance token. Users can stake HFT to vote to govern the protocol. \\n\\n4.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe protocol, metaverse, and token seem to be shariah compliant. The token can be traded in a shariah compliant manner. However, whether the staking token is shariah compliant or not, it would need more research.\\n\\n5.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee', 'Review Date': '13 March 2023'}), Document(page_content=\"ARBITRUM (ARB)\\n\\nName of the Token\\n\\nArbitrum (ARB)\\n\\nCoinGecko Link\\n\\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum-iou\\n\\nCoinMarketCap Link\\n\\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/arbitrum/\\n\\nOfficial Website\\n\\nhttps://arbitrum.io/\\n\\nWhitepaper Link\\n\\n19 March 2023\\n\\n5.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n5.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nArbitrum is a layer 2 solution designed to improve the capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts — boosting their speed and scalability, while adding in additional privacy features to boot.\\n\\nThe platform is designed to allow developers to easily run unmodified Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) contracts and Ethereum transactions on a second layer, while still benefiting from Ethereum's excellent layer 1 security.\\n\\nIt’s built to address some of the shortcomings of current Ethereum-based smart contracts — such as poor efficiency and high execution costs — which have damaged the Ethereum user experience and frequently make transacting an expensive task.\\n\\nArbitrum uses a technique known as transaction rollups to record batches of submitted transactions on the Ethereum main chain, and execute them on a cheap, scalable layer 2 sidechain while leveraging Ethereum to ensure correct results. This process helps to offload most of the computational and storage burden Ethereum currently suffers from, while enabling new classes of powerful layer 2-based DApps.\\n\\n5.1.2. The Token\\n\\nArbitrum does not have its own native token, hence there was no token sale. However, investors hope the project will issue its own token in an airdrop or giveaway. However, Arbitrum operates with Ether crypto. Anything claiming to be its official token should be seen as a scam.\\n\\n5.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nArbitrum is a scaling solution for Ethereum. Arbitrum Rollup is an optimistic rollup protocol that inherits Ethereum-level security. It runs on a blockchain of its own and allows developers to deploy smart contracts which can process a higher number of transactions per second. Users can enjoy faster and cheaper transactions on Arbitrum while interacting with dapps such as DeFi, NFT, marketplace, and more. Arbitrum Orbit makes it easier for developers to launch their own customized Layer 3 chains using Arbitrum's technology stack. In this sense, it is a shariah neutral platform.\\n\\nThere is no token for it, at least for now, therefore, nothing can be said about its token.\\n\\n5.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe protocol is shariah compliant. However, there is no native token of the protocol, therefore, nothing can be said about the token. Once the token is released or issued, a separate shariah review would be needed to know its shariah status.\\n\\n6.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee', 'Review Date': '20 March 2023'}), Document(page_content='Arweave\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMarch 2023\\xa0\\n\\n6.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nArweave\\'s decentralized design aims to make information permanence affordable and scalable. The \"permaweb,\" a new version of the web where webpages and applications are permanently stored and the provenance of content can be traced, is built on the protocol.\\xa0\\n\\nA variety of applications have already been built on the permaweb, including Arweave Web Archive, which lets you archive websites on the permaweb. Other initiatives include Verto, a decentralized trading platform where you can buy and sell profit-sharing tokens, and Gitopia, which lets you keep your code on the blockchain. Tokens created on the Arweave platform that share dividends produced by running decentralized applications are known as profit-sharing tokens (dApps). Moreover, Arweave can be used to store non-fungible tokens indefinitely (NFTs).\\xa0\\n\\nTo store data in the blockweave, a user must pay fees in AR tokens. Arweave miners receive these tokens in exchange for mining new blocks, which obligates them to store data. However, transaction fees do not go entirely to miners. The majority of the transaction fee is allocated to a storage “endowment,” which is distributed to miners over time.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n6.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThe protocol is a generic one in the sense that data storage can include halal and haram elements. Other services such as profit-sharing structure must be reviewed separately for shariah compliance.\\xa0\\n\\n6.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThere are no issues in using the protocol to store data in a shariah compliant manner and to pay for the service using the token.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nAudius is a decentralized, community-owned and artist-controlled music-sharing protocol. Audius provides a blockchain-based alternative to existing streaming platforms to help artists publish and monetize their work and distribute it directly to fans.\\xa0\\n\\nThe mission of the project is to give everyone the freedom to share, monetize, and listen to any audio.\\xa0\\n\\nAudius platform tokens (ticker $AUDIO) have three prongs of functionality within the protocol unlocked by staking:\\xa0\\n\\nSecurity\\xa0\\n\\nFeature access\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nGovernance\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAudius tokens are staked as collateral for a value-added service. In exchange, stakers earn ongoing issuance, governance weight and access to exclusive features. Audius tokens are staked by node operators to run the Audius protocol, and by artists and curators to unlock exclusive features and services. Any $AUDIO staked within the protocol is assigned governance weight, used to shape future iterations of the protocol.\\xa0\\n\\nAudius tokens will serve as collateral for artist-based tooling as well. Early examples incubated by the community include artists tokens, badges and earnings multipliers. In the future, fans may delegate tokens to specific artists and curators to share in their growth on the platform and the issuance of future tokens. Node operators must stake Audius tokens to operate a discovery node or content node, with a larger stake correlating to a higher probability of being chosen by fan clients. Node operators receive direct upside from seeding in the form of $AUDIO and the possibility for future protocol fees for actively seeding the protocol. A community goal, via governance, is to ensure that Audius tokens are always being funneled to the most value-added actors by using on-chain metrics as a measurement, rather than simply to those staking the most tokens but not actively participating in the ecosystem.\\xa0\\n\\n7.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nThe protocol is designed to facilitate the streaming and the publishing of musical works. The token is a utility token that gives access to certain rights and benefits such as voting rights or the right to publish a musical item on the platform.\\xa0\\n\\n7.3.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\n13.1.1. The Protocol\\xa0\\n\\nBalancer is an automated market maker (AMM) that was developed on the Ethereum blockchain. Balancer protocol functions as a self-balancing weighted portfolio, price sensor and liquidity provider.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nThe protocol operates a few types of pools:\\xa0\\n\\nPrivate pools give the owner governance over the pool and make the person the sole contributor of liquidity to the pool. Also, all the parameters are mutable by the owner.\\xa0\\n\\nShared pools are for those who want to become liquidity providers (LPs). The LPs are rewarded with the Balancer Pool Tokens (BPTs).\\xa0\\n\\nSmart pools are like private pools but are controlled by a smart contract. They also reward using BPTs and allow anyone to contribute liquidity to the pool.\\xa0\\n\\nLike most AMMs, Balancer liquidity providers (LPs) earn fees whenever swaps are conducted through pools, they provide liquidity for — this fee is distributed in proportion to the LPs stake in the pool. However, Balancer is rare in the fact that pool managers can set their own fees, these can range from 0.0001% to 10%.\\xa0\\n\\nIt also features support for multi-asset pools — allowing pool owners to include up to eight different assets in their pool. These multi-asset pools give pool managers the flexibility to create complete portfolios that are automatically rebalanced by traders. Unlike some other platforms, trades do not need to be routed through Ether (ETH), helping to reduce slippage for traders.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nBalancer is one of the few AMMs to provide a direct incentive for trading on the platform. For eligible swaps, users earn BAL tokens in proportion to the median gas price and the ETH/BAL exchange rate at the time of their transaction.\\xa0\\n\\n13.1.2. The Token\\xa0\\n\\nBalancer Governance Token (BAL) is the core token behind the Balancer protocol. veBAL is an extension of BAL and is used for voting in decentralized governance.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nveBAL is a time-locked, non-transferable derivative of the 80/20 BAL/ETH BPT on Mainnet. veBAL holders, also called Balancer Governors, vote on proposals relevant to the protocol. These proposals are wide, ranging from which pools to enable BAL to incentivize for how treasury funds are allocated and managed.\\xa0\\n\\nThe BAL token is the primary component of veBAL. Due to the fact that veBAL allows for trading between BAL and ETH, BAL liquidity scales with Governance. Because veBAL liquidity is locked, the market can easily understand how BAL liquidity depth will scale over time by analyzing the unlock schedule of veBAL.\\xa0\\n\\n13.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nBalancer is a decentralized exchange with some unique features. It facilitates transactions and exchange among different crypto assets and charges fees. That fee is shared with the liquidity providers as a profit. In this sense, the protocol is shariah neutral.\\xa0\\n\\nveBAL is the voting power coefficient, and it is not an independent token. BAL token is the token that facilitates governance. In this way, it is a utility token.\\xa0\\n\\n13.3.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nWhen a token is staked, it is dedicated to supporting the strength and security of its network. It is used to validate the transactions by running validator nodes. When someone stakes tokens, he or she can receive a staking reward for their support. In addition to providing stakers with passive income, staking often provides governance rights. However, it also presents the challenge of capital inefficiency because it subjects to bonding and un-bonding periods (ranging from days to weeks).\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nFor example, with the recent Eth 2.0 Merge event, also known as “The Merge”, Ethereum became a Proof-of-Stake chain, allowing users to stake ETH to secure the network and be awarded staking rewards which is expected to yield between 3-6% a year in ETH. However, staked ETH currently cannot be unstaked until the upcoming Shanghai upgrade on April 12, 2023, resulting in ETH being locked up and being capital inefficient. All the ETHs that are staked are sitting idle and not being utilized.\\xa0\\n\\nLiquid staking, one of the latest trends, solves this by allowing users to receive a liquid staked token for staking ETH that they can use in DeFi. Liquid staking providers offer liquid staking services while earning a 5-10% commission fee. After the Shanghai upgrade, ETH can be unstaked, resulting in more users likely to liquid stake their ETH, growing the revenue of liquid staking providers. There is a growing number of liquid staking providers across Ethereum.\\xa0\\n\\n14.1.1. The Protocol\\xa0\\n\\nLido is the liquid staking solution - providing a simple and secure way to earn profit on the digital assets. By staking with Lido the assets remain liquid and can be used across a range of DeFi applications, earning extra yield.\\xa0\\n\\nWhen users liquid stake their ETH, they receive a receipt token which is also known as a Liquid Staked Derivative (LSD). An LSD is a liquid token that is like most other crypto tokens as it is fully fungible, transferable, fractional, etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nLSDs essentially unlock the liquidity of the staked ETH, as it has a similar value of the underlying staked ETH that is temporarily locked. Using the LSD token essentially allows indirectly using your staked ETH in DeFi activities such as selling, providing liquidity, lending it, using it as collateral, etc. to earn additional yield on top of the staking yield that you earn.\\xa0\\n\\nUsers deposit ETH over on Lido’s staking page and receive stETH which is a receipt token from Lido that represents their staked ETH, aka the LSD. This allows them to do DeFi activities, or just hold it to accrue ETH staking rewards in the form of stETH automatically into their wallet. Lido takes 10% of the ETH staking rewards and splits it between node operators and DAO treasury.\\xa0\\n\\nThe Lido DAO is a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation that manages the liquid staking protocols by deciding on key parameters (e.g., setting fees, assigning node operators and oracles, etc.) through the voting power of governance token LDO holders. Also, the DAO will accumulate service fees and spend them on research, development, liquidity mining incentives and protocol upgrades.\\xa0\\n\\n14.1.2. The Token\\xa0\\n\\nLDO is a governance token of Lido which follows ERC20 standard. LDO is the native utility token that is used for:\\xa0\\n\\nGranting governance rights in the Lido DAO.\\xa0\\n\\nManaging fee parameters and distribution.\\xa0\\n\\nGoverning the addition and removal of Lido node operators.\\xa0\\n\\n14.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\xa0\\n\\nStaked tokens on a PoS blockchain, like staked ETH on Ethereum blockchain, are considered security deposits that enable the stakers to run validation nodes. If users choose to stake their ETH through Lido, Lido issues them a receipt of that security deposit that can be used for other activities, making it more liquid. From the shariah perspective, Lido’s staked tokens (i.e., stETH) are receipt of the underlying ETH deposit. If the underlying staked token and the PoS blockchain are shariah compliant, Lido’s staked token (receipt of the deposit) can also be considered shariah compliant.\\xa0\\n\\nLDO token offers certain governance rights to the holder of the token. In this sense, it is shariah neutral.\\xa0\\n\\n14.3.

The Protocol:\\xa0\\n\\nStargate is a community-driven organization building a composable native asset bridge, and a dApp built on LayerZero. Stargate's vision is to make cross-chain liquidity transfer a seamless, single transaction process.\\xa0\\n\\nDeFi users can swap native assets cross-chain on Stargate within a single transaction. For example, users can swap USDC on Ethereum for USDT on BNB.\\xa0\\n\\nApplications can compose Stargate to create native cross-chain transactions at the application level. For example:\\xa0\\n\\nYour favorite DEX can compose Stargate to complete single transaction cross-chain swaps (i.e., swapping AVAX with ETH in a single transaction, all within your favorite DEX's user interface.)\\xa0\\n\\nYour favorite yield aggregator can compose Stargate to deploy assets cross-chain, opening new APY opportunities.\\xa0\\n\\nThese cross-chain swaps are supported by the community-owned Stargate unified liquidity pools.\\xa0\\n\\nThree problems Stargate solves:\\xa0\\n\\nInstant Guaranteed Finality: Users & Applications can trust that when they successfully commit a transaction on the source chain, it will arrive on the destination chain.\\xa0\\n\\nNative Assets: Users & Applications swap in native assets as opposed to wrapped assets that require additional swaps to acquire the desired asset and corresponding fees.\\xa0\\n\\nUnified Liquidity: Shared access of a single liquidity pool across multiple chains creates deeper liquidity for users & applications that trust in the bridge's reliability.\\xa0\\n\\nUses of Stargate:\\xa0\\n\\nUse Stargate to transfer native assets across blockchains. Use transfer to swap 1:1 native asset across different chains. Example: Swap USDC on Ethereum for USDT on BNB.\\xa0\\n\\nEarn rewards by adding liquidity to Stargate pools. Users can add liquidity to token-chain pools (i.e., USDC-Ethereum) and receive either farm-based or transfer-based rewards.\\xa0\\n\\nFarm your LP tokens in exchange for STG rewards. Earn STG and become a member of the Stargate community. Stargate liquidity providers can earn STG rewards by allocating their LP tokens to a Stargate farm.\\xa0\\n\\nLock your STG tokens to receive veSTG, Stargate's governance token. Community members can participate in Stargate DAO governance with an account that has a balance of vote-escrowed STG (veSTG).\\xa0\\n\\n15.1.2. The Token:\\xa0\\n\\n$STG token is the native token of Stargate Finance. There are 1 billion STG that have been minted at genesis. Users can earn STG as rewards for farming their LP tokens. STG tokens can be staked to participate in the governance of the protocol.\\xa0\\n\\n15.2.

It is a cross-chain bridge that can perform exchange of two different tokens in a single transaction. It also tries to remove deficiencies in the whole process with its unique features. This exchange service is valuable from the economic and commercial point of view. It seems shariah neutral because it facilitates all types of crypto assets.\\xa0\\n\\nThe token seems to be shariah neutral because it is a native token of a shariah neutral platform/application. It is distributed as a reward to the users who participate in the platform by providing liquidity. It also offers governance rights through staking.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n30.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nTRON is an open source public blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. TRON is compatible with Ethereum, which means that you can migrate smart contracts on Ethereum to TRON directly or with minor modifications. TRON relies on a unique consensus mechanism to realize the high TPS of the TRON network that is far beyond Ethereum, bringing developers a good experience of a faster transaction.\\n\\nTRON's consensus mechanism is DPOS. TRON supports Http and gRPC APIs, and TRON also provides Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC 2.0 APIs.\\n\\nTRON network transactions need to pay bandwidth and energy fees, where bandwidth is a unit to measure the size of a transaction in bytes. The larger the transaction, the more bandwidth resources will be consumed. Energy is a unit that measures the amount of computation required for TVM to perform specific operations on the TRON network. Energy is calculated in the same way as Ethereum. The more instructions a transaction executes, the more energy it consumes, and the amount of energy consumed by different instructions are different.\\n\\n30.1.2. The Token\\n\\nTRX is the most important cryptocurrency on the TRON network and has a wide range of application scenarios. The rewards on the TRON network are issued in the form of TRX. Users can obtain resources and voting rights by staking TRX. TRX is also used as primary form of collateral in the DeFi lending market, as a unit of account in NFT marketplaces, and so on.\\n\\nTRX is minted when a Super Representative produces a block on the TRON network. Every transaction on TRON consumes bandwidth or energy. When a user's bandwidth or energy is insufficient, they need to burn TRX to pay for the resources required for the transaction. The burning of TRX can not only help reduce the inflation of TRX, but also prevent accidental or malicious transactions from occupying all TRON network resources.\\n\\n30.2.

Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n31.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nMakerDAO is a decentralized organization. The Maker Protocol employs a two-token system. The first being Dai, a collateral-backed stablecoin that offers stability. It is required to have any business or individual realize the advantages of digital money. Second, there is MKR, a governance token that is used by stakeholders to maintain the system and manage Dai. MKR token holders are the decision-makers of the Maker Protocol, supported by the larger public community and various other external parties.\\n\\nIt accepts any Ethereum-based asset as collateral to generate Dai given that it has been approved by MKR holders and has been given specific, corresponding Risk Parameters through the Maker decentralized governance process.\\n\\n31.1.2. The Token\\n\\nThe Dai stablecoin is a decentralized, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Dai is held in cryptocurrency wallets or within platforms and is supported on Ethereum and other popular blockchains.\\n\\nUsers generate Dai by depositing collateral assets into Maker Vaults within the Maker Protocol. This is how Dai is entered into circulation and how users gain access to liquidity. Others obtain Dai by buying it from brokers or exchanges, or simply by receiving it as a means of payment.\\n\\nEvery Dai in circulation is directly backed by excess collateral, meaning that the value of the collateral is higher than the value of the Dai debt, and all Dai transactions are publicly viewable on the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nIt is important to differentiate between Multi-Collateral DAI and Single-Collateral DAI (SAI), an earlier version of the token that could only be collateralized by a single cryptocurrency; SAI also doesn’t support the DAI Savings Rate, which allows users to earn interest by holding DAI tokens.\\n\\n31.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nDAI is created out of loans made by the platform to the users. The interest on these loans is paid through the stability fee. This stability fee should not be confused with a maintenance fee or service fee for using the Maker Vault. It is clear that the crypto deposits are used as collateral for borrowing DAI. Hence, if the collateralization ratio drops below 150% the trader’s collateral will be liquidated to pay off their loan.\\n\\nIn this way, DAI is created out of an interest-based loan (transaction). Interest-based loans or transactions are not Shariah-compliant.\\n\\n31.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBased on the above discussion, DAI is not Shariah-compliant.

Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for simple use cases, such as payment transactions and assets transfer.\\n\\n32.1.1. The Token\\n\\nSui has a native token called SUI, with a fixed supply. The SUI token is used to pay for gas, and users can stake their SUI tokens with validators in a Delegated Proof-of-Stake model within an epoch. The voting power of validators within this epoch is a function of the amount of SUI in their staking pool, including both validator and user SUI tokens. In any epoch, the set of validators is Byzantine fault tolerant. At the end of the epoch, fees collected through all transactions processed are distributed to validators according to their contribution to the operation of the network. Validators can in turn share some of the fees as rewards to users that stake their SUI with them.\\n\\nThe SUI token serves four purposes on the Sui platform:\\n\\n·       Users can stake SUI to participate in the proof-of-stake mechanism.\\n\\n·       SUI is the asset denomination needed for paying the gas fees required to execute and store transactions or other operations on the Sui platform.\\n\\n·       SUI can be used as a versatile and liquid asset for various applications including the standard features of money – a unit of account, a medium of exchange, or a store of value – and more complex functionality enabled by smart contracts, interoperability, and composability across the Sui ecosystem.\\n\\n·       SUI token plays an important role in governance by acting as a right to participate in on-chain voting on issues such as protocol upgrades.\\n\\n32.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Shariah nature of the Sui protocol is that it is a decentralized platform that allows users to send and receive value without the need for a central authority.\\n\\nThe Islamic legal characterization of the Sui token is that it is a digital asset that can be used to pay for transactions, secure the network, and participate in governance. SUI is a limited supply token, which means that it has a fixed value and cannot be inflated.\\n\\nThere are no major elements or vital components in the Sui protocol or token that are prohibited in Shariah. Sui does not directly involve interest, does not involve gambling, and does not have any elements of excessive uncertainty or unethical or immoral activities by design or as a default feature.\\n\\n32.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the Shariah opinion of the Sui protocol and token is that they both are halal (permissible). Sui is a decentralized platform that allows users to send and receive value.\\n\\n33.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'SUI', 'Official Website': 'https://sui.io/', 'Official Documentation Link': 'https://docs.sui.io/learn', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sui-iou/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sui-iou', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee', 'Review Date': '23 May 2023'}), Document(page_content='Ethereum Classic (ETC)\\n\\nName of the Protocol\\xa0\\n\\nEthereum Classic\\n\\n33.1. Main Function of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\n33.1.1. The Protocol\\n\\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, ETC. ETC was created in 2016 after a hard fork of the original Ethereum blockchain. The hard fork was caused by a disagreement among the Ethereum community about how to handle a security exploit that had been discovered in the Ethereum code.\\n\\nThe main objective of Ethereum Classic is to provide a decentralized platform for smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that are stored on the blockchain. They can be used to automate a variety of tasks, such as financial transactions, property ownership, and voting.\\n\\nEthereum Classic’s main aim is to preserve the Ethereum blockchain as it originally was, without artificially countering the DAO hack.\\n\\nIts appeal was first to those who disagreed with Ethereum’s response, but the legacy network has since gained a wider fan base, which include major investors such as Barry Silbert, CEO of investment firm Grayscale.\\n\\nAs a voluntary organization, the developers of ETC do not aim to turn the network into a for-profit entity. Users pay transaction fees as with Ethereum, and miners collect them based on work done as per the proof-of-work (PoW) mining algorithm.\\n\\nUnlike Ethereum, Ethereum Classic has no plans to convert to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mining algorithm, while multiple developers continue to work on future improvements such as scaling solutions.\\n\\n33.1.2. The Token\\n\\nThe ETC token is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum Classic network. It is used to pay for fees on the network, to secure the network through mining, and to participate in governance.\\n\\nETC is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency. This means that it is mined by solving computationally difficult problems. The network is secured by a network of miners who compete to solve these problems.\\n\\n33.2. Shariah Description of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Ethereum Classic protocol is a decentralized platform that allows users to create and execute smart contracts. It is designed to be secure, private, and scalable.\\n\\nFrom a Shariah perspective, it does not involve any prohibited activities, such as interest, gambling, or excessive uncertainty. The protocol is also decentralized, which means that it is not subject to the control of any single entity. This makes it a more secure and trustworthy platform for conducting transactions.\\n\\nThe ETC token is a payment token that is used to pay for fees on the Ethereum Classic network, to secure the network through mining. The Islamic legal characterization of the ETC token is that it is a digital asset that is used to pay for network transaction fees and to secure the network through staking. ETC tokens can also be used to purchase goods and services on decentralized applications (dApps) that are built on the Ethereum Classic blockchain.\\n\\nThere are no vital elements or integral components in the Ethereum Classic protocol or token that are prohibited in Shariah. The protocol is decentralized and does not directly involve any interest, gambling, or excessive uncertainty. The token is also a digital asset that is not backed by any physical asset.\\n\\n33.3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token:\\n\\nThe Shariah opinion of the Ethereum Classic protocol and token is that they both are halal (permissible). The protocol is decentralized and does not involve any interest, gambling, or excessive uncertainty. The token is also a digital asset that is not backed by any physical asset, which makes it compliant with Shariah law.\\n\\n34.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'ETC', 'Official Website': 'https://ethereumclassic.org/', 'Official Documentation Link': 'https://ethereumclassic.org/knowledge', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-classic/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic', 'Initial Assessment': 'Dr Farrukh Habib', 'Reviewer': 'Mufti Billal Omarjee'}), Document(page_content='Beam\\n\\nOfficial Docs Link: \\n\\nhttps://docs.onbeam.com/\\n\\nDr Farrukh Habib\\n\\nSection 1.

Critical Description of the Protocol\\n\\nCelestia is a unique blockchain protocol known for its modular data availability network. Its main aim is to simplify the process of launching independent blockchains. The protocol achieves this by scaling securely with the number of users and providing a platform where transactions are ordered and published but not executed. This modular approach decouples the consensus and application execution layers, offering new possibilities for decentralized application builders.\\n\\n2. Critical Description of the Token/Coin\\n\\nThe native asset of Celestia, TIA, plays a vital role in the protocol\\'s ecosystem. Developers use TIA to pay for data availability services through PayForBlobs transactions, which incur a fee denominated in TIA. The token also facilitates the launching of new blockchains on the Celestia network, serving as a gas token and currency. This allows developers to quickly bootstrap their chains without needing to issue a new token immediately. Additionally, TIA is used for staking to secure the network through a proof-of-stake mechanism and enables community participation in decentralized governance, including voting on network parameters and managing the community pool\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nSection 2: Islamic Legal Analysis of the Protocol and Coin/Token\\n\\nThe Celestia platform and its native token TIA require an analysis from an Islamic legal perspective focusing on the Shariah nature of the platform/protocol and the Islamic legal characterization of the token. To determine their compliance with Islamic principles, it is essential to examine if there are any elements in the protocol or token that are prohibited in Shariah, such as interest (usury), gambling (قمار, ميسر), excessive uncertainty (غرر), and other unethical or immoral activities.\\n\\nShariah Nature of the Platform/Protocol:\\n\\nCelestia, as a modular blockchain network, primarily provides a platform for blockchain development and data availability services. From an Islamic legal perspective, this type of service is generally permissible as long as the activities and services facilitated by the platform do not involve any prohibited (haram) elements under Shariah law.\\n\\nIslamic Legal Characterization of the Token:\\n\\nThe TIA token, as a digital asset used within the Celestia ecosystem for various transactional purposes, can be considered a \"مال متقوم\" (valuable property) in Islamic jurisprudence.

Critical Description of the Protocol\\n\\nBonk is not a protocol, but a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain. It gained attention by drawing liquidity into the Solana ecosystem. The coin is dog-themed and was created with the intention of bringing liquidity back to the Solana ecosystem. The developers of Bonk aimed to provide a more equitable and fairer ecosystem, contrasting with the existing tokenomics they perceived as toxic within the Solana community. They sought to rebuild decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity in the Solana ecosystem, which had faced challenges prior to Bonk\\'s launch\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\n2. Critical Description of the Token/Coin\\n\\nThe Bonk Coin (BONK) was introduced in December 2022 as a community-driven alternative during a period of difficulties for the Solana platform. The developers identified challenges within Solana, such as nefarious entities profiting without supporting its growth. To counteract this, Bonk was launched with a massive airdrop, distributing approximately half of its total token supply to members of the Solana community, including NFT developers, investors, and key players. This not only boosted Solana\\'s price but also promised long-term impacts for the community.\\n\\nBONK is designed to empower users and support the growing dApps ecosystem on Solana. Its operational function is like other tokens on the Solana blockchain, allowing users to transfer BONK tokens, use them in dApps, or trade them on DEXs. The token aims to support the Solana ecosystem and foster a lively community around it. Future plans for BONK include expanding its utility within the Solana ecosystem, potentially integrating it within various dApps and incentivizing community participation\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nSection 2: Islamic Legal Analysis of the Protocol and Coin/Token\\n\\nShariah Nature of the Coin:\\n\\nAs a meme coin, BONK\\'s compliance with Shariah principles is questionable. Meme coins typically lack intrinsic value or utilitarian purpose, often driven by speculation rather than asset/project-backed value. This could potentially align with the concept of gharar (excessive uncertainty) in Islamic finance.\\n\\nIslamic Legal Characterization of the Token:\\n\\nThe BONK token, being part of a meme coin project, may not qualify as \"مال متقوم\" (valuable property) in Islamic jurisprudence due to its speculative nature and lack of intrinsic value or asset/project backing.\\n\\nExamination of Prohibited Elements:\\n\\nInterest (Usury): There\\'s no clear indication that the BONK token involves interest-based transactions.\\n\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): The speculative nature of meme coins like BONK can be akin to gambling, which is prohibited in Islam.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (غرر): The volatility and speculative nature of BONK introduce elements of excessive uncertainty.\\n\\nUnethical/Immoral Activities: The involvement of BONK in any unethical or immoral activities, if any, would render it non-compliant with Shariah.\\n\\nSection 3: Shariah Opinion of the Coin\\n\\nBased on the available information and general Islamic finance principles, the BONK meme coin does not appear to be in alignment with Shariah principles. Its speculative nature, lack of intrinsic value, and potential alignment with Gharar and gambling-like characteristics make it questionable in terms of Shariah compliance. Therefore, it is not Shariah-compliant.\\n\\n \\n47.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'BONK', 'Official Website': 'https://www.bonkcoin.com/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bonk1/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bonk', 'Reviewer': 'NULL', 'Review Date': 'NULL', 'Report Expiry Date': 'NULL'}), Document(page_content='SUI\\n\\nOfficial Docs Link: \\n\\nhttps://docs.sui.io/\\n\\nDr Farrukh Habib\\n\\n07 December, 2023\\n\\n06 December, 2024\\n\\nSection 1: Main Functions of the Protocol and Token\\n\\n1.

Its permissibility hinges on the nature of the transactions it enables and whether these adhere to Islamic financial principles.\\n\\nExamination of Prohibited Elements:\\n\\nInterest (Usury): The token must not be involved in any interest-bearing transactions.\\n\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): The platform and token should not be used for gambling-like activities or speculative ventures without real asset backing.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (غرر): Transactions within the platform must avoid excessive uncertainty or lack of transparency.\\n\\nUnethical/Immoral Activities: Any involvement in activities deemed unethical or immoral according to Islamic principles would render the platform and token non-compliant.\\n\\nSection 3: Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token\\n\\nBased on the available information, the Sui protocol and its SUI token do not exhibit elements explicitly prohibited in Shariah. If the platform and its token are used in a manner that adheres to Islamic financial principles, they could be considered Shariah-compliant.

Main Functions of the Protocol and Token\\n\\n1. Critical Description of the Protocol\\n\\nTHORChain is a decentralized liquidity protocol providing cross-chain asset swaps using an automated market maker (AMM) model. It facilitates seamless trading of assets across different blockchains. The protocol\\'s key features include decentralized operation, cross-chain swaps, and liquidity pools where users can contribute and earn rewards. However, THORChain also offers \\'Savers\\' and \\'Lending\\' products, which may have implications for Shariah compliance due to their potential involvement in interest-based transactions.\\n\\n2. Critical Description of the Coin/Token\\n\\nRUNE is the native utility token of THORChain, essential for liquidity provision, network security through staking, and possible governance participation. It functions as a base currency in liquidity pools and is vital for the ecosystem\\'s economic activities.\\n\\nSection 2. Islamic Legal Analysis of the Protocol and Coin/Token\\n\\nShariah Nature of the Platform/Protocol:\\n\\nWhile THORChain\\'s primary function of facilitating cross-chain swaps aligns with Islamic finance principles, its \\'Savers\\' and \\'Lending\\' products raise concerns. In Islamic finance, any form of Riba (interest/usury) is strictly prohibited. If these products involve earning or paying interest, they would not be Shariah-compliant.\\n\\nIslamic Legal Characterization of the Coin/Token:\\n\\nRUNE, as a utility and governance token, remains a \"مال متقوم\" (valuable property) in Islamic law. However, its Shariah compliance also depends on the nature of transactions it facilitates, especially in context of \\'Savers\\' and \\'Lending\\' products.\\n\\nExamination of Prohibited Elements:\\n\\nInterest (Usury): The \\'Savers\\' and \\'Lending\\' features of THORChain potentially involve interest, which is a significant concern from a Shariah perspective.\\n\\nGambling (قمار, ميسر): Apart from these features, the protocol mainly facilitates asset trading, which needs to be free from gambling elements.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (غرر): While market risks are inherent, the protocol should avoid transactions characterized by excessive uncertainty.\\n\\nOther Prohibited Activities: Compliance also depends on ensuring no involvement in transactions or activities considered haram in Islam.\\n\\nSection 3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token\\n\\nConsidering the potential involvement of Riba in THORChain\\'s \\'Savers\\' and \\'Lending\\' products, these specific aspects of the protocol are not Shariah-compliant. Based on this understanding, the $RUNE does not appear to be in alignment with Shariah principles.\\n\\n \\n49.', metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'RUNE', 'Official Website': 'https://thorchain.org/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/thorchain/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/thorchain', 'Reviewer': 'NULL', 'Review Date': 'NULL', 'Report Expiry Date': 'NULL'}), Document(page_content=\"Immutable\\n\\nOfficial Docs Link: \\n\\nhttps://support.immutable.com/en/articles/6470640-immutable-whitepaper\\n\\nDr Farrukh Habib\\n\\n07 December, 2023\\n\\n06 December, 2024\\n\\nSection 1: Main Functions of the Protocol and Token\\n\\n1. Critical Description of the Protocol\\n\\nImmutable X is a Layer-2 blockchain solution designed to address scalability issues for NFTs on Ethereum. It enables the creation and management of NFT projects with zero gas fees, offering quick trade confirmation and large scalability for games, applications, and marketplaces, without compromising security\\u200b\\u200b. Key functionalities include:\\n\\nBuilding web3 games on the Immutable X protocol.\\n\\nBuying and selling assets on the Immutable X marketplace.\\n\\nDepositing and withdrawing ETH or IMX tokens between Immutable X and Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nTransferring IMX assets via TokenTrove, an NFT marketplace on Immutable X.\\n\\nVoting on community grant proposals with IMX tokens\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\n2. Critical Description of the Coin/Token\\n\\nThe IMX token, an ERC-20 utility token, has three primary roles in the Immutable X ecosystem:\\n\\nFees: A 2% protocol fee is applied to every transaction, of which 20% is converted to IMX and allocated to the staking rewards pool.\\n\\nStaking: IMX holders can stake their tokens to earn a portion of the protocol fees as staking rewards. The rewards are proportional to the amount of IMX staked and are distributed every 14 days.\\n\\nDecentralized Governance: IMX token holders have voting rights on token-related proposals, including allocating token reserves, developer grants, activating rewards, and changes in token supply. Voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nSection 2: Islamic Legal Analysis of the Protocol and Coin/Token\\n\\nShariah Nature of the Platform/Protocol:\\n\\nAlthough Immutable X protocol facilitates the creation, management, and trade of NFTs on a secure blockchain platform, but the fact that this protocol is aimed at gaming raises some concerns. Most of the games involve music, questionable characters’ appearances, storylines, themes, and sometimes betting. They also do not have a direct economic utility or benefit. Therefore, Immutable X protocol does not align with the Islamic finance principle of providing tangible services or assets. Its operations involve Shariah-prohibited activities, assuming the content of NFTs and related transactions adhere to Islamic guidelines.\\n\\nIslamic Legal Characterization of the Coin/Token:\\n\\nDue to the nature of the protocol, the IMX token, as a utility and governance token within the Immutable X ecosystem, could not be considered a valid asset. Assuming it represents a stake in ventures and derives the economic value from the protocol itself, it is not a valid property.\\n\\nExamination of Prohibited Elements:\\n\\nInterest (Usury, Riba): There's no indication that the protocol or IMX token involves interest-based transactions.\\n\\nGambling or Lottery (Qimar or Maysir): The protocol's focus on NFTs and digital assets trading doesn't inherently involve gambling or lottery elements.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (Gharar): The protocol appears to provide functionalities and transaction terms, thereby avoiding excessive uncertainty. However, the normal volatility of the cryptocurrency market is present.\\n\\nOther Prohibited Elements: the main purpose of the protocol is to facilitate gamers, game developers, and games, which are highly questionable from the Shariah perspective. The protocol is assumed to have prohibited elements. Consequently, the token derives its value from the prohibited subject matter.\\n\\nSection 3: Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token\\n\\nImmutable X protocol, from a technical design perspective, seems to violate some Shariah principles. The IMX token cannot be considered a valid intangible asset in Islamic law. Therefore, the protocol and the tokens are impermissible to be used. They are not Shariah-compliant.\\n\\nDisclaimer:\\n\\nThis review report solely focuses on the Shariah compliance of the overall protocol/project and its associated coin/token. It does not extend to the Shariah implications of specific products, utilities, or services offered by the protocol, such as staking, yield farming, or others. Users are advised to exercise their own judgment or seek separate guidance from us regarding the Shariah compliance of any specific product or service.\\n\\n \\n\\n50.\", metadata={'Name of the Protocol': 'NULL', 'Name of the Token': 'IMX', 'Official Website': 'https://www.immutable.com/', 'CoinMarketCap Link': 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/immutable-x/', 'CoinGecko Link': 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/immutable-x', 'Reviewer': 'NULL', 'Review Date': 'NULL', 'Report Expiry Date': 'NULL'}), Document(page_content='Mantle\\n\\nOfficial Docs Link: \\n\\nhttps://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/overview\\n\\nDr Farrukh Habib\\n\\n08 December, 2023\\n\\n07 December, 2024\\n\\nSection 1. Main Functions of the Protocol and Token\\n\\n1. Critical Description of the Protocol\\n\\nProtocol Overview: Mantle Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is EVM-compatible, allowing cross-deployment of applications from the Mainnet and other EVM chains\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nMechanics and Products: Mantle uses Optimistic rollups, which facilitate cheap and fast transactions by bundling and executing transactions off-chain, with eventual settlement on-chain. This approach improves user experience without sacrificing security and decentralization\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nMain Objectives: The network aims to provide efficient communication with the main Ethereum network, process transactions at lower costs and higher throughput, and leverage Ethereum’s security\\u200b\\u200b. It is designed to be iterative and modular, potentially integrating zero-knowledge technology as it evolves\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\n2. Critical Description of the Coin/Token\\n\\nToken Overview: MNT is the native token of the Mantle Network. It functions as a gas token within the network, supporting ecosystem growth and serving as a governance token\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nMain Usage and Functions: MNT is a utility and governance token, giving holders voting rights on ecosystem decisions. It is used to initiate and power future Mantle products. A recent proposal was passed by MNT holders to reduce the token supply in the treasury\\u200b\\u200b. Additionally, in a merger with BitDAO, BIT tokens are being converted to MNT at a 1:1 ratio, consolidating BitDAO and Mantle into a single entity\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nSection 2. Islamic Legal Analysis of the Protocol and Coin/Token\\n\\nShariah Nature of the Platform/Protocol:\\n\\nMantle Network, as a blockchain solution focusing on scaling and efficiency, aligns with the principle in Islamic finance of promoting economic activities and technological advancements. The network’s focus on security, decentralization, and efficiency does not inherently involve Shariah-prohibited activities. The modular nature of the network allows for continuous development, which can be viewed positively in Islamic ethics, emphasizing progress and innovation.\\n\\nIslamic Legal Characterization of the Coin/Token:\\n\\nThe MNT token, serving as a utility and governance token within the Mantle ecosystem, can be classified as \"مال متقوم\" (valuable property) in Islamic law, assuming it represents a stake in permissible activities and has economic value. Its usage for governance and transactional purposes within the network aligns with Islamic financial principles, provided these activities remain Shariah-compliant.\\n\\nExamination of Prohibited Elements:\\n\\nInterest (Usury): There is no indication that the Mantle protocol or the MNT token involves interest-based transactions.\\n\\nGambling or Lottery (Qimar or Maysir): The protocol\\'s primary function does not revolve around gambling or speculative high-risk investments.\\n\\nExcessive Uncertainty (Gharar): While normal crypto market volatility is present, it\\'s considered a business risk, not the prohibited excessive uncertainty (Gharar). The protocol itself does not introduce additional elements of Gharar.\\n\\nOther Prohibited Elements: There is no evidence suggesting involvement in activities deemed unethical or immoral under Islamic law.\\n\\nSection 3. Shariah Opinion of the Protocol and Token\\n\\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, Mantle Network and its MNT token do not exhibit elements that are explicitly prohibited in Shariah. The protocol\\'s focus on improving blockchain efficiency and security, along with the governance role of the MNT token, aligns with Islamic financial principles. Therefore, the Mantle protocol and the MNT tokens are permissible to be used. However, their permissibility is also determined by their application and usage. Users should ensure that their interactions/transactions, such as trading, investment, and holding with the protocol or token, are aligned with Islamic principles.\\n\\nDisclaimer:\\n\\nThis review report solely focuses on the Shariah compliance of the overall protocol/project and its associated coin/token.
