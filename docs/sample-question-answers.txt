Ask me about crypto protocols: Is Bitcoin (BTC) Shariah-compliant?

Yes, Bitcoin (BTC) is considered Shariah-compliant. The document states that Bitcoin does not contain any explicitly Shariah-prohibited elements and adheres to the legal maxim in Shariah that the original rule is that of permissibility in financial transactions. It is permissible to exchange Bitcoin for other currencies, as well as accept them as a counter value in commodity transactions, and it could be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies that are considered permissible.




Ask me about crypto protocols: Can you explain why Ethereum (ETH) is considered Shariah-compliant or non-compliant?


Ethereum (ETH) is considered Shariah-compliant based on the analysis provided in the document. The main reasons for its compliance are as follows:

1. **Decentralized Nature**: Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that supports the execution of decentralized smart contracts. Its decentralized nature means it is not controlled by any single entity, which aligns with the principles of fairness and transparency in Islamic finance.

2. **Utility and Functionality**: Ethereum serves as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies and for executing decentralized smart contracts. This utility-based approach, where the platform is used for various applications, is considered Shariah-neutral. It can be used for purposes that are compliant with Islamic principles.

3. **No Inherent Haram Activities**: The core functions and objectives of Ethereum do not involve activities that are inherently prohibited in Islam, such as gambling, usury (interest), or investment in haram (forbidden) industries.

4. **Shariah Certification**: The ETH protocol and the currency have been certified as Shariah-compliant by Amanie Advisors. This certification is based on a critical analysis of the objectives, structure, and nature of Ethereum, indicating that no Shariah issues are fundamentally present in the protocol and token.

5. **Use of Ether (ETH)**: Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform, is used to pay for transaction fees (Gas) and is the base currency of the network. The concept of paying 
for transaction fees or using a currency for transactions within a network does not contradict Shariah principles, as long as the transactions themselves are Shariah-compliant.

In summary, Ethereum's design as a decentralized platform for applications, its lack of inherent haram activities, and its certification by a recognized Shariah advisory firm contribute to its classification as Shariah-compliant. However, it's important to note that while the platform itself is considered compliant, the specific use cases or applications built on Ethereum must also be evaluated individually for Shariah compliance.
 


How does the Shariah compliance of Bitcoin compare to that of Ripple (XRP)?


The Shariah compliance of Bitcoin and Ripple (XRP) share similarities in that both are considered permissible (halal) under Islamic law, but they are recognized for different aspects within their respective protocols and uses.

**Bitcoin (BTC):**
- Bitcoin is recognized as a decentralized digital currency that operates without a central authority, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions directly between users.
- It is considered a form of "mal" (property or wealth) and fulfills the criteria of money in Islamic jurisprudence due to its wide acceptance and usage.
- Bitcoin does not contain any explicitly Shariah-prohibited elements, adhering to the principle that financial transactions are permissible unless proven otherwise.
- It is permissible to exchange Bitcoin for other currencies, goods, and services, and it can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies considered permissible under Islamic law.

**Ripple (XRP):**
- Ripple's XRP Ledger is an open-source, permissionless, and decentralized blockchain network designed to facilitate the transfer of value efficiently and with low transaction fees.
- XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger, is used to pay transaction fees and hold value. It is not subject to inflation, which aligns with Shariah principles against usury (riba). 
- The XRP Ledger and XRP are considered Shariah-compliant because they do not involve interest-based transactions or other prohibited activities.
- The decentralized nature of the XRP Ledger, not being owned or operated by any single entity, and its utility in facilitating transactions without involving prohibited activities, contribute to its Shariah compliance.

In summary, both Bitcoin and Ripple (XRP) are considered Shariah-compliant, but their compliance is recognized based on their operational mechanisms and the principles they adhere to. Bitcoin is noted for its role as a decentralized currency facilitating direct peer-to-peer transactions, while Ripple's XRP is recognized for its efficient, low-cost transfer of value on a decentralized ledger without involving prohibited activities.
